91~WHILE shoot A veryhighfrequencyomnidirectionalradiorange approach TO camarilloairport AS A flightinstructor WE WERE TOLD TO INTERCEPT THE FINAL approach COURSE AND MAINTAIN _ feet TILL establish ONCE ON THE COURSE THE NEXT stepdown WAS TO _ feet.WHILE BUSY WITH MY STUDENT I fail TO NOTICE HIM go BELOW _ feet.BY THE TIME I realize IT WE WERE AT _ feet.I TOLD HIM TO climb backup TO _ feet.WHILE climb airtrafficcontrol call A lowaltitude ALERT ON US AND WE say WE WERE climb backup TO _ feet.AFTER THAT THE approach WENT FINE.THE BIG THING ABOUT THE approach IS SHORT LOSS OF altitude WITHIN _ mile AND WHEN YOU GET BUSY teach IT IS EASY TO LOSE SIGHT OF THE WHOLE PICTURE.
92~WHILE climb TO _ feetmeansealevel AS assign BY airtrafficcontrol WE HIT AN UPDRAFT AT _ feetmeansealevel THAT cause THE AIRPLANE TO GO FROM _ FPM TO _ FPM ON THE verticalspeedindicator.WE WERE fly WITH THE autopilot engage AND altitude SELECT depress.WHEN WE HIT THE UPDRAFT WHILE fly THROUGH A SMALL CELL THE altitude SELECT disengage BY ITSELF AS THE aircraft accelerate TO _ FPM climb AND THE airspeed jump FROM _ knotsindicatedairspeed TO _ knotsindicatedairspeed.I immediate retard THE throttle TO IDLE AND start trim fullnose DOWN AND attempt TO DEPRESS THE PRESELECT altitude KEY TWICE.THE climb RATE WAS TOO GREAT FOR THIS FUNCTION SO I HIT THE CAPTURE KEY AS WE WERE climb THROUGH _ feetmeansealevel ALL THE WHILE STILL trim DOWN.WE arrest THE climb AT _ feetmeansealevel AND start BACK DOWN TO _ feetmeansealevel.WE end UP descend BACK TO _ feet BEFORE WE level SINCE WE WERE SO AGGRESSIVE IN try TO STOP THE PLANE FROM climb AT THIS TIME THE control ask US OUR altitude assign AND MY firstofficer reply _ feet.THE control THEN ask OUR CURRENT altitude AND I respond _ feet AND descend TO _ feet WE HIT AN UPDRAFT IN THAT CELL AND IT pop US UP.hi respond WAS THAT WASN T GOOD ENOUGH THAT WE SHOULD HAVE alert HIM immediate WITH THE problem.HOWEVER WE COULDN T AVOID THE CELL SINCE WE DIDN T WANT TO DEVIATE WITHOUT permit AND THE frequency WAS congest.THEN DURING THE altitude climb THROUGH I WAS SO BUSY fly THE aircraft I DIDN T HAVE THE TIME TO TAKE TO TALK TO airtrafficcontrol.I WAS BUSY alert MY firstofficer WHILE I TOOK measure TO CORRECT THE ERROR.THE control CAME BACK WITH A NUMBER WE need TO CALL FOR A POTENTIAL violate INTO ANOTHER aircraft south AIRSPACE THAT WAS fly ABOVE US.I BELIEVE TO PREVENT A recur WE EITHER NEED MORE control WHEN THE weather IS DOWN SO THERE IS MORE airtime TO COMMUNICATE avail OR PUT A large separate between aircraft THAN _ feet WHEN THERE IS moderaterain AND convectiveactivity IN THE AREA TO BE fly IN.
93~_ minute BEFORE depart flightcrew inform US THAT number _ veryhighfrequency WOULD NOT transmit ONLY RECEIVE.THE FULL TIME mechanic WENT INTO THE east and east COMPARTMENT AND say HE swap number _ veryhighfrequency communicate WITH THE SPARE onboard.I WENT upstair AND check operate OF RADIO AND FOUND TO BE work NORMAL.I THEN sign OFF THE LOGBOOK AS replace number _ veryhighfrequency communicate receive AND check GOOD.IN real THE mechanic swap number _ navigate receive WITH SPARE.
94~I depart AT _ FROM luk airport ON A ROUTINE traffic WATCH flight WITH _ report onboard.I TOOK OFF ON runway WITH THE MOON AND star clear VISIBLE.AS I climb TO OUR cruisingaltitude OF _ feetmeansealevel I notice SOME VERY LIGHT WISPY SCUD ABOUT _ mile north OF THE airport.I turn west TO GO OVER DOWNTOWN WHICH WAS ABOUT _ mile AWAY.THEN AS WE proceed north ALONG THE INTERSTATE _ AT _ feet I notice THAT AN UNDERCAST WAS begin TO FORM BELOW US AT AN estimate _ feet.THIS WAS ABOUT _ minute INTO THE flight AND I TOLD MY passenger THAT THE weather WAS NOT AS FORECAST AND THAT WE WERE go TO goback INTO luk airport BEFORE condition deteriorate ani FURTHER.THERE WERE SOME break IN THE UNDERCAST AND I descend THROUGH on OF THEM TO _ feet AS I turn toward THE airport.AT THIS POINT I report TO THE luk airport commontrafficadvisoryfrequency _ THAT I WAS ON _ mile FINAL TO runway.I HAD GOOD ground visible AT THIS POINT BUT forwardvisibility WAS LESS THAN _ mile.I HAD tune IN THE runway locate FOR courseguidance BUT WAS NOT ON AN instrumentflightrules approach clearance.I DID NOT HAVE A glideslope receive SO I descend TO _ feet FOR THE straightin runway locate minimum.AT approximate _ feet AND ABOUT _ mile northeast OF THE airport I enter instrumentmeteorologicalconditions WHICH last ABOUT _ second.WE BROKE OUT INTO margin visualmeteorologicalconditions ABOVE THE airport AT WHICH POINT I MADE AN UNEVENTFUL land ON runway AT approximate _.THE tower open AT _.forecast AND CURRENT CONDITION report indicate goodvisualflightrules condition FOR THE DURATION OF THE propos _ hour flight.A rapid form cloudlayer OVER luk airport AND THE surroundingarea drop condition FROM visualflightrules TO instrumentflightrules IN A PERIOD OF approximate _ minute.I DID THE RIGHT THING BY turn TO THE airport AS SOON AS I SAW condition deteriorate.I SHOULD HAVE enlist THE HELP OF cvg airport approach AND file AN instrumentflightrulesflight PLAN.I BROKE THE federalaviationregulation BY continue visualflightrules INTO instrumentmeteorologicalconditions.I WAS aid BY be instrument CURRENT AND have AN instrumentflightrules equip aircraft.THE speed OF THE develop cloud WAS UNUSUAL AND NOT SOMETHING I HAD experience BEFORE.IN THE FUTURE I WILL MAINTAIN visualflightrules ON TOP IF NECESSARY UNTIL AN APPROPRIATE clearance CAN BE obtain FROM airtrafficcontrol.MY MISTAKE WAS TO TRY AND DUCK UNDER BEFORE thing GOT ani WORSE.I REALIZE THAT COULD HAVE BEEN FATAL AND WAS certain A fool MISTAKE.I WILL NOT MAKE THE SAME ERROR IN THE FUTURE AND WILL us THIS AS A LESSON OF WHAT NOT TO DO WITH MY student.
95~WE WERE LEVEL AT CRUISE enroute TO SPB veryhighfrequencyomnidirectionalradiorange AND WERE IN CONTACT WITH control ON _ AND WERE TOLD BY control TO CONTACT control ON _.I readback _ AND change frequency AND check IN AT _ meter.tamper acknowledge OUR check in.AFTER A PERIOD OF TIME WERE TOLD TO CALL tamper ON ANOTHER frequency AND WE DID.short AFTER THIS A flight call US AND say ST PETERSBURG want TO TALK TO US ON _.I call ST PETERSBURG ON THE OTHER RADIO AND THEY want TO KNOW WHY WE HADN T call THEM AT ST PETERSBURG.I attempt TO EXPLAIN THAT WE WERE give _ BY THE PREVIOUS RUSSIAN control AND THAT WE HAD check IN ON THAT frequency.ST PETERSBURG say I THINK YOU KNOW YOU SHOULD CALL US ON _.I attempt TO EXPLAIN THAT WE DID CALL ON THE frequency WE WERE give BUT I AM NOT SURE HOW MUCH HE understand.HE THEN say I THINK WE probable FILE A report.note THIS WAS MY firsttrip TO MOSCOW AND I HAD A LIST OF THE frequency IN ORDER OF us AND refer TO IT DURING THE flight.THEY ALL match EXCEPT THE LAST frequency ON THE WAY OUT WHICH WAS NEITHER _ NOR _.WHILE I DID NOTICE THAT I HAD NO REASON TO THINK THAT WE WERE ON THE wrongfrequency SINCE tamper WAS THE nextsector AND THE control ON _ DID NOT SAY ANYTHING TO INDICATE THAT WE WERE ON THE wrongfrequency AND IN FACT subsequent GAVE US A NORMAL handoff TO THE nextsector.IN MANY area IT IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR A control TO HAND YOU OFF TO THE nextsector WHILE YOU ARE STILL IN hi AIRSPACE AND I assume THAT WAS WHAT WAS go ON HERE.THE firstindication THAT I HAD THAT ANYTHING WAS AMISS WAS WHEN I call ST PETERSBURG ON _.THE radio WERE OF MEDIOCRE QUALITY AND THE frequency ON WHICH WE WERE give THE CHANGE TO _ WAS particular WEAK AND HOLLOW BUT THE firstofficer AND I ARE BOTH SURE WE hear _ AND THAT IS WHAT I readback TO THE control.IT IS POSSIBLE THAT WE BOTH misunderstand HIM AND THAT HE DID NOT CATCH THE ERROR ON READBACK.IN THE FUTURE I WILL obvious KNOW THAT ST PETERSBURG doe NOT handoff EARLY BUT OVERALL I WILL QUESTION THE control IF THE AGENCY I AM talk TO doe NOT MATCH THE flightinformationregion I AM IN.

97~ON september _ I HAD TO TAXI A _ SERIES aircraft.THE tailnumber WAS XYZ.FROM GATE XX TO THE HANGAR I GOT clearance LIKE I WAS suppose TO FROM PUSHBACK AT GATE XX.THEN ground tower say TO PROCEED AND HOLD SHORT OF taxiway Y.THEN left turnontaxiway Y TO runway AND crossrunway runway AND FOLLOW companyaircraft IN FRONT OF ME.THEN tower say TO FOLLOW companyaircraft TO taxiway north AND TO HANGAR.WHILE I WAS cross runway BEHIND companyaircraft tower say I SHOULD HAVE HELD SHORT OF runway WHICH I THOUGHT tower say TO FOLLOW companyaircraft TO park AT HANGAR.
98~AFTER WE WERE clear FOR THE SABINE arrive INTO HOUSTON WITH clearance TO CROSS SMITH AT _ feet AND _ knot WE proceed TO COMPLY WITH THE arrive.THE firstofficer pilotflying WAS A LITTLE BEHIND THE desire PROFILE FOR OUR restrict AND elect TO EXTEND THE speedbrake.OUR RATE OF descend increase AND WE return TO THE flightmanagementcomputer PROFILE lateralnavigation verticalnavigation FROM LEVEL CHANGE.JUST AS WE stow THE board WE GOT A leadingedge TRANSIT cautionlight ON THE FORWARD CONSOLE.I note THE GAUGE indicate THE flap WERE IN FACT UP.THE OVERHEAD leadingedgedevice PANEL HOWEVER indicate THE number _ SLAT WAS partial extend GREEN CELL LIGHT ON.I jiggle THE FLAP HANDLE AND suggest THE firstofficer SLOW DOWN WHICH HE DID.THE LIGHT WENT OUT BUT CAME ON IN LESS THAN A minute AND I begin TO RUN THE abnormalchecklist QRH.IT WAS OBVIOUS WE WOULD NOT MAKE SMITH AT _ feet AND _ knot SO I report SAME TO ZHU.ZHU MADE NO REPLY TO MY inable TO MAKE THE restrict BUT pass ME TO approachcontrol.ON ROLLOUT AND TAXI IN WITH flap UP WE GOT THE SAME _ light.maintain WAS advise AND A writeup WAS MADE.IN discuss WITH maintain WE WERE inform THIS WAS A recurringproblem WITH aircraft ABC.NOTHING WAS CURRENT IN THE maintenancelog PAST writeup WHICH I HAD review early ALSO THE ASYMMETRY protect circuitbreaker HAD ALREADY BEEN pull AND collar require TO DO TO minimumequipmentlist aircraft FOR nextflight.THIS IN MY OPINION WAS UNSATISFACTORY IF THE PRIOR writeup WAS clear THAT circuitbreaker SHOULD HAVE BEEN RESET.I WAS fly AROUND WITHOUT ASYMMETRY protect.WE NEED TO PAY MORE attention TO detail AND actual FIX aircraft WITH problem.ALTHOUGH EVERYTHING work OUT safe I STILL WONDER IF WE MADE SMITH AT _ feet _ knot OR IF ZHU EVER hear ME SAY I HAD A problem.I WAS work ON safe FIRST.
99~seem TO BE A recurringproblem WITH powerport typeaircraft.HAVE see sever aircraft SO equip THAT HAVE expose wire IN SEAT TRACK cause A trip HAZARD TO passenger.ALSO HAD passenger COMMENT THAT WHEN HE see thing SUCH AS THIS IT make HIM WONDER ABOUT THE maintain OF THE aircraft.I HAVE HAD TO REPLACE sever OF THESE BLUE PLASTIC WIRE retain MYSELF SO IT IS NOT JUST A local problem.
100~locate _ mile north OF GREGS.weather ALL AROUND.control VERY BUSY.DIDN T LET US OUT OF flightlevel UNTIL _ mile north OF GREGS AND TOLD US TO CROSS GREGS AT _ feet AND _.WE DID OUR BEST BUT overshoot BY _ mile.WE COULDN T GET A WORD IN TO THE control HE WAS TOO BUSY.
101~THE problem arise WHEN I WAS UNABLE TO PROVIDE MY flightinstructor AND pilot certificate UPON THE REQUEST OF AN federalaviationadministrationinspector.I WAS provide instruct IN A FRESCA _ flighttrainingdevice AT THE TIME.contribute factor MAY HAVE BEEN THE REMOTE locate OF THE flighttrainingdevice south FROM instruct south office.THE OTHER contribute FACTOR WAS MY OWN IRRESPONSIBILITY DURING prepare FOR THE LESSON.I simple forget TO GRAB MY certificate WHEN collect material FOR THE LESSON.IN ORDER TO PREVENT ani recur OF THIS EVENT I WILL NOW carryon MY PERSON AT ALL time A NEW certify HOLDER.THE NEW HOLDER IS MORE COMPACT AND WILL BE easy transport._ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report state THAT HE WAS concern ABOUT be IN violate OF THE federalaviationregulation FOR NOT have THE certificate IN hi possess.HOWEVER THE inspect WAS try TO DETERMINE IF THE federalaviationadministration approve SCHOOL train COURSE WAS be follow AND IF THE instruct meet THE approve instruct qualification.IT WOULD HAVE help THAT determine IF THE report HAD THE certificate IN hi possess.
102~file dab airport DIRECT _ DIRECT _.clearance receive AND readback TO _ bywayof crg airport _ degree RADIAL ROYES AS file.I fly THAT clearance.AFTER pass ROYES intersect fly DIRECT TO _ center advise MY clearance WAS ROYES crg airport AS file.I ask IF I SHOULD PROCEED OR turnback TO crg airport.THEY say THEY WOULD check.NO direct WAS give AND THEY say TO CONTINUE pass OVER _ I BELIEVE THAT clearance SHOULD HAVE BEEN word TO _ bywayof radarvector ROYES airway CRAIG AS file THEN I WOULD HAVE understand THAT CRAIG WAS A FIX TO BE fly TO NOT A veryhighfrequencyomnidirectionalradiorange THAT THE _ degree RADIAL origin FROM.
103~WHILE do touch and go AT A nontower control airport UNDER THE report weathercondition WE encounter A NEAR MISS WITH A cpr airport aircraft.ON THE DOWNWIND LEG AS WE turn BASE WE spot THE cpr airport aircraft shoot A straightin locate approach.SINCE THE visible WAS ONLY _ mile AND HAZE IT IS suspect THAT HE remain WITH approachcontrol AND NEVER MADE ani announcement ON THE commontrafficadvisoryfrequencyfrequency UNTIL ON THE ground.WE HAD MADE ALL THE PROPER announcement BUT NEVER hear HIM SAY on WORD ON THE commontrafficadvisoryfrequency UNTIL HE taxiedto THE RAMP.ALTHOUGH IT sound LIKE DEJA VU AGAIN A WORD OF warn ALL JET OR highperformance operator fly INTO nontower control airport.CLASS east AND classgairspace doe NOT REQUIRE EXTRA goodvisibility TO flyin legal.BE care.
104~ON september _ WE receive OUR schedule aircraft XYZ A _ IN PHOENIX azimuth.WE notice AT preflight THE flightattendant PA system WAS inoperative AND write UP.WE fail TO NOTICE THIS WAS A classb CATEGORY minimumequipmentlist enter september _.OUR flight FROM LAS VEGAS BAKERSFIELD TO PHOENIX ON september _ exceed THE TIME LIMIT ON THE CATEGORY B minimumequipmentlist make THIS aircraft ILLEGAL.THIS CATEGORY COULD HAVE BEEN extend IF WE WERE ALERT TO THE CORRECT minimumequipmentlist CATEGORY.WE overlook THIS BY think THIS minimumequipmentlist WAS A CATEGORY C allow US _ day TIME FOR REPAIR.THIS COULD HAVE BEEN avoid BY us BETTER communicate skill FROM AN easy LESS involve minimumequipmentlist RESEARCH DISPATCH aware AND captain TO firstofficer communicate.
105~clear TO CROSS TURLO intersect AT flightlevel.start DOWN LATE AND realize WE MIGHT BE HIGH.WE advise airtrafficcontrol AND request clearance TO CROSS HIGH.airtrafficcontrol advise THERE WAS traffic OVER TURLO AT flightlevel.WE cross TURLO descend THROUGH flightlevel.NO apparentconflict BUT WE WERE NEVERTHELESS HIGH.
106~I FLY FOR A SCENIC TOUR operate AND WAS fly A TOUR THAT origin IN MONUMENT VALLEY AND ALSO end IN MONUMENT VALLEY.THE TOUR include fly OVER PART OF LAKE POWELL AND RAINBOW BRIDGE.I AND _ OTHER aircraft WERE AT RAINBOW BRIDGE WHEN on OF OUR aircraft visual spot A PILATUS _ aircraft IN THE AREA AND advise US TO BE ON THE LOOKOUT.WE ALWAYS COMMUNICATE ON frequency _ THROUGHOUT THE tour AND MAKE ALL positionreport ON THAT samefrequency.THE _ WAS monitor _ AND AFTER HE hear US talk ABOUT HIM HE report THAT HE HAD ALL _ OF US IN SIGHT.WE continue AND announce THAT WE WOULD BE do righthand turn AROUND RAINBOW BRIDGE AND WE ALSO announce THE altitude WE WERE AT AND THOSE WE WOULD BE climb TO AS WE circle THE BRIDGE.I announce I WAS start MY right turnon THE BRIDGE leave _ feet FOR _ feet.WHEN I WAS approach _ feet AND STILL IN A TURN THE _ aircraft fly FROM MY left TO MY right ABOUT _ feet IN FRONT OF ME.HE WAS make A left turnaround THE BRIDGE AT THE samealtitude THAT WE WERE climb TO.I THEN ask HIM IF HE HAD see ME.HE apologize AND announce THAT HE WAS bug OUT.I THEN call OUR operate IN TO INFORM THEM AND TO ASK THEM TO GET THE aircraftregistration NUMBER AND pilotname IF POSSIBLE.THEY WERE ONLY ABLE TO GET ME THE number.I THINK THE pilot OF THE _ ONLY HAD A COUPLE OF US IN SIGHT AND WASN T listen TO THE specify LIKE direct OF turn AND altitude.I DON T BELIEVE ani reason pilot WOULD CHOOSE TO MAKE turn IN THE oppositedirection AND AT THE samealtitude AS _ OTHER aircraft AROUND RAINBOW BRIDGE.
107~WE WERE shoot THE veryhighfrequencyomnidirectionalradiorange _ approach INTO LSE.I WAS pilotflying AND MY firstofficer WAS pilotnotflying.WE WERE hand OFF TO LSE tower ABOUT _ mile FROM mix finalapproachfix.tower instruct US TO report mix INBOUND.WE configure cross mix AND head DOWN TO OUR minimumdescentaltitude.MY firstofficer NEVER report mix AND SO WE WERE NOT clear TO LAND UNTIL WE CAME OUT OF THE cloud AROUND _ feetabovegroundlevel OR SO AND tower SAW US.contribute factor WERE THAT THE firstofficer WAS BRAND NEW IT WAS earlymorning AND WE WERE VERY BUSY AND distract by AN ARC TO A nonprecision approach CLOSE TO minimum.nexttime I WILL KEEP A close EYE ON MY pilotnotflying special WHEN THEY ARE NEW TO THE COMPANY AND THE aircraft.
108~inflight CRUISE FROM _.flightlevel AT flightlevel approximate _ knotsindicatedairspeed.WE WERE restrict TO flightlevel DUE TO SINGLE PACK operate.takeoff AND climb TO altitude WERE NORMAL.I HAD JUST turn OFF THE FASTEN seatbeltsign AND MADE AN announce.WHEN IN THE VICINITY OF RZS WITH THE autopilot ON WE start TO ENCOUNTER A LIGHT BUFFET.THE aircraft NOSE THEN pitch UP slight AND roll TO THE left AND THEN pitch DOWN.THE captain pilotflying immediate disengage THE autopilot roll wing LEVEL AND start A GRADUAL climb BACK TO altitude.IT feel AS IF WE roll ABOUT _ degree AND WE LOST _ feet OF altitude.ONCE THE aircraft WAS BACK IN STABLE flight THE captain ask airtrafficcontrol WHO WAS AHEAD OF US AND HOW WERE THE ride.airtrafficcontrol say THERE WAS A heavy _ ABOUT _ mile AHEAD WHO HAD climb UP THROUGH OUR altitude.AT THIS POINT WE call BACK TO THE flightattendant.THE chiefflight attend say THE OTHER _ flightattendant WERE HURT AND THERE WERE MULTIPLE injury TO passenger.WE GOT AS MUCH inform FROM THE flightattendant AS POSSIBLE AND declare OURSELVES A LIFEGUARD emergency aircraft WITH airtrafficcontrol.AT THIS POINT WE WERE ABOUT _ WAY TO sfo airport AND WITH THE concur OF _ doctor onboard WHO WERE assist WE decide TO CONTINUE ON TO sfo airport.THE descend AND land WERE UNEVENTFUL.WE WENT TO THE GATE WHERE THE aircraft WAS meet BY paramedic AND airportofficial.performanceconsideration DUE TO THE FACT THAT _ OUT OF THE _ flightattendant WERE HURT IT WAS HARD TO GET time COMPLETE inform IN THE flight STATION AS TO WHAT WAS happen IN THE BACK.THIS slow UP THE decisionmaking PROGRESS.
109~I WAS captain ON flight XYZ ON september _.federalaviationadministrationinspector enter COCKPIT AND ask FOR OUR credential THEN WENT INTO CABIN DURING board TO INSPECT._ minute PRIOR TO depart HE state OUR LAVATORY TRASH BIN door WERE NOT IN comply WITH airworthinessdirective _ AND PART _ AND _.AFTER _ _ hour DELAY AND phonecall TO THE companymaintenance coordinate AND THE ATLANTA federalaviationadministrationflightstandardsdistrictoffice THEY determine THE aircraft WAS INDEED IN comply WITH airworthinessdirective _ AND PART _ _.WITH THE back OF THE federalaviationadministration ATLANTA flightstandardsdistrictoffice AND companymaintenance AND OUR CONTRACT maintain AND A TELETYPE FROM COMPANY state THE aircraft WAS SAFE TO FLY AND IN comply WITH ALL airworthinessdirective AND federalaviationregulation WE block AND close ALL lavatory JUST TO BE SURE AND THE aircraft TOOK OFF WITH ALL appropriatelogbook PAPERWORK COMPLETE.inspect OF THE MIAMI flightstandardsdistrictoffice state HE WAS NOT get ON THE aircraft WITH US BECAUSE IT WAS NOT SAFE AND NOT IN comply WITH airworthinessdirective OR federalaviationregulation.HE ALSO say HE WOULD TAKE ACTION AGAINST MYSELF AND MY COMPANY.BECAUSE OF THIS THREAT I AM submit THIS report.ON arrive IN ATLANTA OUR maintenancepeople say THE aircraft WAS NORMAL AND IN comply.supplementalinformation FROM airborneclassificationnumber _ PRIOR TO PUSHBACK AN federalaviationadministrationmaintenance inspect WHO WAS go TO RIDE OUR jumpseat advise US ALL _ lavatory WERE NOT IN comply WITH AN airworthinessdirective.HE WAS FROM THE mia airport flightstandardsdistrictoffice OUR COMPANY comply WITH THE airworthinessdirective sever year AGO AND IT WAS check TO BE IN comply BY THE atl airport flightstandardsdistrictoffice.THIS inspect WAS interest IN violate US.IT seem TO BE THE flightstandardsdistrictoffice IN mia airport IS NOT STANDARD WITH THE flightstandardsdistrictoffice IN atl airport.TO BE LEGAL FOR DISPATCH IN THE OPINION OF THE inspect WE PUT ALL _ lavatory ON THE minimumequipmentlist.
110~WE WERE give A cross restrict IN descend TO CROSS DANDD intersect AT flightlevel AFTER be reassign TO DANDD _ standardterminalarrivalroute DUE TO weather deviate.WE WERE BUSY WITH descend approach brief AND program AS WELL AS deviate FOR weather.WE realize ABOUT _ mile FROM DANDD THAT WE HADN T initiate descend AND WOULD BE TOO HIGH TO COMPLY WITH restrict.WE WERE NOT call BY airtrafficcontrol ON OUR altitude.WE call HIM AND advise HIM THAT WE WOULD BE UNABLE TO MAKE DANDD AT flightlevel.HE reply IT DOESN T APPEAR THAT WAY.AND say IT WOULD NOT BE A problem AND GAVE US vector TO ASSIST US IN descend.
111~WERE operate AS flight FROM _.WERE give clearance TO CROSS MADISON veryhighfrequencyomnidirectionalradiorange AT _ feetmeansealevel THEN WAS notify BY ZBW TO WATCH FOR crossingtraffic left TO right AND BELOW OUR altitude WHILE descend TO COMPLY WITH OUR _ feetmeansealevel cross restrict AT OVER MAD.BOTH pilot WERE look OUTSIDE AS IS CUSTOMARY FUNDAMENTAL PARAMOUNT AND STANDARD WHILE conscientious monitor OUR trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _ SCREEN WHICH GAVE US A BRIEF ALERT OF THE crossingtraffic AT OUR loweraltitude.DUE TO time OF crossingtraffic AS report BY ZBW WE WERE UNABLE TO MEET THE restrict OVER MAD collocate veryhighfrequencyomnidirectionalradiorange and tacticalairnavigation.airtrafficcontrol inform US THAT FOR inform purpose WE WERE A LITTLE LONG HIGH AT OVER MAD.therefor I AM NOW submit THIS report TO nationalaeronauticsandspaceadministration TO PROTECT MY LICENSE AND CAREER.

113~DURING VISUAL approach AT approximate _ knotsindicatedairspeed flap HANDLE WAS place IN posit number _ brief AND THEN posit number _.ECAM MESSAGE WAS annunciate FOR slat FAULT.ECAM procedure WAS follow WHICH call FOR recycle OF flap.slat remain AT ZERO degree BUT flap extend normal.AN UNEVENTFUL land WAS MADE.
114~WHILE be vector FOR approach BY mco airport WE WERE turn _ degree IN BOTH left AND right FIRST TO _ degree THEN BACK TO _ degree.ANOTHER aircraft airbase AND WE WERE aircraft aircraft approach WAS confuse callsign.GAVE US _ feet AND WE WERE AT _ feet.WHILE try TO VERIFY altitude WE WERE vector INTO turbulent AND LOST _ feet TO _ feet AND THEN climb TO _ feet.
115~AFTER fly A charterflight FROM _ WE TOOK OFF FROM bos airport WITH NO abnormalindication FROM THE AIRPLANE.uneventfulflight UNTIL land ROLLOUT.AFTER touch DOWN AND start TO SLOW AROUND _ milesperhour THE aircraft start TO VIBRATE AND PULL TO THE left.attempt TO MAINTAIN direct control I HAD TO us FULL right RUDDER AND SOME right BRAKE.AT THAT TIME I THOUGHT I MUST HAVE A BLOWN TIRE.I notify MY COMPANY ON frequency AND WE shutdown THE AIRPLANE ON THE runway.WHEN WE exit THE AIRPLANE AND verify THAT IT WAS A FLAT MAIN TIRE left WE THEN notice to airman ED THE runway close AND HAD TO CHANGE THE TIRE AT THE SIGHT WHERE WE shutdown.THE AIRPLANE stay ON THE PAVEMENT AND THERE WAS NO FURTHER INCIDENT.THE runway WAS close FOR ABOUT _ minute.THE onlydamage TO THE aircraft WAS THE left MAIN TIRE.supplementalinformation FROM airborneclassificationnumber _ BOTH pilot add FULL right RUDDER TO MAINTAIN direct control.WE HAD aeronauticaladvisorystation CLOSE THE runway.
116~flight final taxi OUT FROM GATE approximate _ minute latedue TO delay cause BY RAMP CLOSURE FROM LIGHTNING AND maintain south assist WITH INSUFFICIENT OXYGEN onboard TO CARRY THE federalaviationadministrationmaintenance safetyinspector WHO WAS ride ON OUR jumpseat.NO soon DID WE final taxiout FROM THE GATE WHEN PIT close THE airport FOR departure DUE TO A LEVEL _ thunderstorm pass OVER THE FIELD.WE HELD ON taxiway C SHORT OF taxiway V FOR approximate _ minute AT WHICH POINT CONCERN OVER drop BELOW OUR takeoff minimumfuel LOAD BECAME A real.NOW OVER _ hour LATE AND IN AN ATTEMPT TO AVERT have TO RETURN TO THE GATE TO REFUEL I elect TO shutdown THE number _ engine TO CONSERVE FUEL WHILE WE wait OUT THE STORM.approximate _ minute LATER THE airport open TO ALL aircraft BUT US AS phl airport HAD impose FURTHER depart delay FOR ALL INBOUND phl airport FLTS.BECAUSE OUR flight WAS AT THE number _ SPOT hold SHORT OF taxiway V WE WERE IN THE WAY OF aircraft wait BEHIND US WHO COULD DEPART SO airtrafficcontrol instruct US TO MOVE BEHIND THE DEICE PAD TO WAIT FOR OUR phl airport SLOT.BECAUSE THE AIRBUS IS NOT allow TO TAXI WITH _ engine WE commence WITH THE crossbleed engine procedure TO START THE number _ engine.THE HANDBOOK natural ask THAT YOU ENSURE THE AREA BEHIND YOU IS clear PRIOR TO conduct THIS procedure AND UPON ask airtrafficcontrol IF IT WAS clear BEHIND US WE learn THAT airtrafficcontrol HAD posit A commuteraircraft direct BEHIND US.STUCK between A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE OF choose between advance power suffice ENOUGH TO START AN engine AND RISK possible blow THE commuteraircraft BEHIND US OR slow EASING THE powerup ON THE singleengine SO AS TO reposition TO A POINT WHERE THE crossbleed START COULD BE accomplish I choose THE LATTER AS I deem IT TO BE THE safestcourse OF ACTION.EITHER ACTION WOULD HAVE BEEN conduct AGAINST companypolicy THE FACT THAT EITHER HAD TO BE perform WITH AN federalaviationadministrationinspector onboard IS REGRETTABLE.THE inspect commend MY copilot AND I FOR A JOB WELL DONE ONCE WE final arrive IN phl airport SO IT IS assume THAT HE IS EITHER UNAWARE THAT THE AIRBUS IS NOT recommend TO TAXI singleengine OR HE IS true A logic HUMAN be WHO understand THE PREDICAMENT THAT WAS BEFORE US.LESSON learn WHEN try TO CONSERVE FUEL FOR THE COMPANY AND FURTHER delay FOR OUR passenger CHOOSE ONLY TO shutdown AN engine AT A locate WHERE NO on ELSE CAN BE posit BEHIND YOU OR pilot WILL BE face WITH THE SAME DILEMMA EACH TIME THE engine MUST BE restart.
117~ON A flight FROM sjc airport TO hio airport.WHILE climb THROUGH approximateflightlevel IN THE VICINITY OF RBL veryhighfrequencyomnidirectionalradiorange I notice A FUEL IMBAL OF approximate _ pound.THE left WING HAD THE excessfuel.BOTH tiptanks WERE EMPTY.I perform THE NORMAL procedure require TO balance THE FUEL BY turn THE STANDBY fuelpump IN THE heavy left WING ON AND open THE XFLOW VALVE.AFTER A FEW minute pass I notice THAT THE FUEL WAS NOT balance.I check THE fuelpanel confine AND determine THAT IT WAS CORRECT.AFTER A FEW MORE minute I notice THAT THE FUEL WAS STILL NOT balance.I ask THE copilot TO VERIFY THE FUEL IMBAL AND TO VERIFY THAT THE fuelpanel WAS IN THE CORRECT confine.HE verify THAT THE FUEL WAS OUT OF balance AND THE fuelpanel set WERE IN THE CORRECT posit TO balance THE FUEL.I THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS THE STANDBY fuelpump IN THE left WING WAS NOT work.I check THE circuitbreaker AND IT WAS IN.THIS DID NOT CORRECT THE problem.I THEN ask THE copilot TO check hi circuitbreaker.HE DID.THEY WERE ALL IN.AT THIS POINT I decide TO RETURN TO hwd airport WHICH IS OUR maintenancebase.THEN I ask THE copilot TO CONSULT THE checklist FOR FUEL abnormal WHILE I fly THE aircraft.HE consult THE abnormalchecklist FOR THE fuelsystem.WE WERE approximate _ minute FROM hwd airport.AT THIS POINT THE copilot begin work ON the fuelsituation.THE FUEL BECAME MORE UNBALANCED.THERE WAS approximate _ pound OF FUEL IN THE left WING AND _ pound IN THE right WING.AT THIS POINT I TOLD THE copilot TO DECLARE AN emergency IN ORDER TO GET priorityhandling BACK TO hwd airport.THE copilot suggest THAT I us differentialpower TO HELP balance THE FUEL.WHICH I DID.HE THEN suggest THAT HE transfer FUEL TO THE FUSELAGE TANK IN ORDER TO LIGHTEN THE LOAD IN THE left WING.WHICH HE DID.I TOLD THE copilot TO INFORM airtrafficcontrol THAT WE WOULD BE singleengine.HE DID.WE THEN brief THE singleengine land AND consult THE singleengine land checklist.THEN I pull THE right engine BACK TO IDLE.WE THEN ask airtrafficcontrol IF WE COULD FLY fast THAN _ knot BELOW _ feet IN ORDER TO AID STABILITY AND TO KEEP A highpower set ON THE left engine WHICH WOULD BURN MORE FUEL AND HELP THE balance.airtrafficcontrol approve THIS.AFTER THIS WE consider land AT A close airport.BUT CAME TO THE conclude THAT IF WE fly long THE FUEL IMBAL WOULD less AND THE aircraft WOULD BECOME easy TO control.AND WE WERE VERY FAMILIAR WITH hwd airport AND THE surroundingarea.WHEN WE WERE ABOUT _ mile FROM hwd airport I determine THAT THE aircraft WAS control ENOUGH TO LAND.THE right engine DID NOT flameout BUT WE LEFT IT IN IDLE FOR THE approach.THE land AT hwd airport WAS UNEVENTFUL.MY majorerror WAS NOT identify THE problem correct.THIS lead ME TO NOT direct THE copilot TO THE properchecklist.THERE IS A checklist FOR FUEL IMBAL DURING FUEL transfer.I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE checklist AND THE fuelsystem.ANOTHER ERROR WAS WHEN I DID NOT FIND A checklist FOR our situate WE SHOULD HAVE return THE fuelpanel TO THE posit IT WAS IN BEFORE THE IMBAL begin get WORSE.THE correctiveaction FOR THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN TO CLOSE THE XFLOW VALVE AND TURN THE left STANDBY PUMP OFF.THE LEARJET HAS A KIT avail THAT indicate WHEN THE STANDBY PUMP IS receive power.IF OUR aircraft HAD THIS modify WE COULD HAVE identify THE problem soon.I AM ask MY employ TO CONSIDER modify THE aircraft WITH THIS KIT.

224~FINAL approach TO runway AT surfaceaviationobservation PAULO BRAZIL.I WAS IN THE jumpseat.tune IN RAMP frequency AND GOT A gateassignment.I look UP TO SEE THE speed WELL INTO THE YELLOW BOX AND SAW THE captain advance throttle TO maximum.pilotflying firstofficer LATER say THAT THE captain HAD THE speedbrake extend WITH flap _ degree WHICH cause THE airspeed TO DETERIORATE rapid.aircraft DID NOT STALL.humanfactor WE WERE A TENSE CREW BECAUSE WE ARE ALL MIAMI base pilot WHO LEFT home AND FAMILY member IN THE PATH OF HURRICANE DUE TO IMPACT MIAMI.
225~AS I WAS taxi TO runway AT mdw airport I miss MY TURN AND inadvertent cross runway.ANOTHER aircraft WAS IN THE PROCESS OF take OFF AND HAD TO ABORT hi takeoff ROLL TO AVOID ME.contribute factor WERE MY FATIGUE DUE TO THE TIME OF DAY THE dark AND TIGHT SCHEDULE requirement.
226~I HAD JUST pick UP A new purchase CESSNA _ FOR MY COMPANY.MYSELF AND A coworker check THE aircraft OVER thorough PRIOR TO MY TAXI.DURING TAXI I MADE ALL THE APPROPRIATE uncontrolledairport call.I taxiedto runway _ AND DID MY runup.DURING THAT TIME on aircraft enter traffic FOR runway _ AND land.ANOTHER aircraft HAD call INBOUND BUT NOT YET enter THE PATTERN.I pull OUT ON THE runway _ AND begin MY takeoff ROLL.AGAIN I announce MY takeoff AROUND rotate THE INBOUND CESSNA call ENTRY left DOWNWIND FOR runway _.I proceed TO liftoff AND climbout runway _ make A left OUT OF traffic AWAY FROM THE CESSNA.BY THIS TIME THE CESSNA WAS turn BASE.THE pilot OF THE CESSNA begin TO SCREAM ABOUT WHAT HE perceive AS AN UNSAFE SIT AND want TO KNOW WHY I WASN T make radiocall.THE scream CESSNA pilot WAS VERY UPSET AND effect block THE aeronauticaladvisorystationfrequency FOR A minute OR SO UNTIL aeronauticaladvisorystation ask IF HE WOULD CEASE AND CONTINUE hi question AFTER HE HAD land.HE comply.AFTER A FEW minute WITH THE CESSNA _ I decide THE aircraft WAS function OK AND WENT TO PICK UP MY instrumentflightrulesclearance HOME ONLY TO FIND THE number _ RADIO WAS NOT transmit.SO I GUESS THE scream CESSNA HAD A POINT I WAS NOT get OUT OF THE aircraft WITH MY select RADIO.HOWEVER I MUST ALSO SAY AT NO TIME WAS I EVEN CLOSE TO THE arrive CESSNA BUT I DID HAVE A HAND IN upset THE EXCITABLE pilot TO THE POINT HE effect shutdown communicate AT VARANGO FRANKLIN COUNTY PA AND ALL OTHER airfield ON THE samefrequency.
227~HOW THE problem arise THE weather WAS UP AND DOWN _ _ _ AS FOG WAS move IN AND AROUND IN PATCHY area.THE FACT THAT THE FOG WAS PATCHY AND THIN GAVE goodvisibility OF THE runway AT time.THE approach WAS AN instrumentlandingsystem AND YOU COULD SEE THE runway AT time AS WE approach minimum.IT IS MY BELIEF THE pilot look UP AND SAW THE runway AND THOUGHT HE COULD LAND.HE THEN lostsight OF THE runway AND start A goaraound.AS THE aircraft rotate IT STRUCK THE ground MONETARILY.WE complete THE miss approach AND return TO PALMER safe.I BELIEVE WITH THE EFFECT OF lead in highintensity strobelight AND THE patchyfog THE pilotflying experience AN ILLUSION AS TO be ABLE TO LAND.ALSO THE FACT THE FOG WAS move DID NOT HELP.IN aircraft operate THIS SHOULD NOT HAVE occur.THE pilotflying WOULD REMAIN ON instrument UNTIL THE copilot call posit runwayenvironment IN SIGHT.I BELIEVE THIS COULD BE A seriousproblem FOR pilot fly singlepilot instrumentflightrules operate BECAUSE OF THIS EFFECT.
228~WHILE IN OUR breakroom between FLTS THE captain WAS approach BY AN mke airport flightstandardsdistrictoffice avionic inspect.HE TOLD US THERE WAS BLACK TAPE wrap AROUND THE END OF THE right pitottube obstruct THE DRAIN HOLE.THE captain verify IT AND immediate notify OUR maintenancepersonnel.AFTER HE write UP THE DISCREPANCY WE continue OUR duty prepare FOR THE nextflight.DURING THIS TIME THE inspect discover A burn OUT BULB ON THE STEP LIGHT ON THE CABIN airstairdoor _ OF _.THE captain write UP THE DISCREPANCY AND GOT maintain TO REPLACE THE BULB.WE accept THIS aircraft early IN THE DAY FROM ANOTHER CREW.WE DON T KNOW HOW MANY crew fly THIS aircraft WHO MAY NOT HAVE notice THESE discrepancy.WITH THE pitottube ALREADY be A dark COLOR OF GRAY IT MADE THE slight burn BLACK TAPE DIFFICULT TO NOTICE.EVEN THOUGH THIS IS NOT AN EXCUSE THIS WAS THE CIRCUMSTANCE.WE ALSO fly THE aircraft early AND DID NOT NOTICE ani irregular.IN add SINCE IT WAS DAYTIME THE burn OUT BULB ON THE airstairdoor WAS NOT discover IN THE early preflightinspection SINCE IT WAS NOT need.TO CONCLUDE THE recommend learn FROM THIS EXPERIENCE ARE THE necessary TO PERFORM A MORE thoroughpreflight inspect AND look FOR THE UNEXPECTED.
229~ON depart COLIN _ FROM _ THE CREW THOUGHT AND readback climb AND MAINTAIN _ feet.AT _ feet airtrafficcontrol ask FOR OUR altitude BECAUSE oppose aircraft WAS descend THROUGH _ feet.THE depart call FOR A climb TO _ feet BUT WE THOUGHT _ feet enroute TO _ feet.airtrafficcontrol HAS TO PAY attention TO readback TO COMPLETE THE check AND balance.supplementalinformation FROM airborneclassificationnumber _ WE PUT IN THE WRONG depart altitude OF _ feet IN WHICH IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN _ feet.THIS WAS THE RESULT OF BOTH pilot NOT review thorough THE standardinstrumentdeparture.RICHMOND depart advise US AT _ feet WE WERE climb TO THE wrongaltitude.
230~THE takeoff WAS nightvisualflightrules.WE HAD BEEN clear INTO posit AND HOLD ON runway ORD WHILE WE WERE wait FOR takeoffclearance.THE captain notice flashingred light AT AN UNSPECIFIC DISTANCE DOWN THE runway.THERE WAS construct IN THE VICINITY OF THE runway PAD SO WE figure IT WAS PART OF THE construct light SINCE THE redlight WERE OFF THE right SIDE OF THE runway.WHILE ON takeoff ROLL WE keep watch THE AREA OF THE light AND IT begin TO TAKE A SHAPE.WE WERE try TO FOCUS ON WHAT THE SHAPE WAS BUT SINCE IT HAD NO OTHER light ON AND WAS DARK IN COLOR IT DIDN T REFLECT MUCH LIGHT AND JUST look LIKE A GRAY BLOB.final WE recognize IT AS AN aircraft AND THAT IT HAD it NOSE SECTION stick INTO THE runway.IT WAS HARD TO JUDGE OUR DISTANCE FROM THE aircraft BUT BY THE TIME WE realize WHAT IT WAS IT WAS TOO LATE TO STOP AND AVOID IT.WE WERE LIGHT SO WE start TO ROTATE EARLY.AS WE rotate THE OTHER aircraft WHICH HAD BEEN STATIONARY TILL THIS POINT start TO TAXI ACROSS THE runway IN FRONT OF US.AS WE clear THE OTHER aircraft IT WAS direct BELOW US.tower appear TO BE UNAWARE OF THE OTHER aircraft TILL AFTER WE HAD clear THE airportboundary.REST OF TRIP WAS NORMAL AND THE passenger appear TO BE UNAWARE OF WHAT HAD happen.TO ME IT seem THE biggestfactor AFTER LACK OF communicate between groundcontrol AND THE OTHER aircraft WAS THE LACK OF light ON THE OTHER aircraft AND THE PAINT COLOR.IT DIDN T HAVE ani CABIN light OR run light THAT WE COULD SEE AND THE COLOR OF THE aircraft seem TO ABSORB OUR land light INSTEAD OF reflect ani LIGHT BACK AT US SO IT mean WE HAD TO GET close TO PICK OUT A SHAPE.
231~AS MY CREW WAS fly INTO DENVER FROM PUEBLO I ask HOW MANY passenger AND minimumfuel require FOR flight XXX TO _.I WAS TOLD _ PEOPLE AND _ pound FUEL FOR MINIMUM.WITH OUR AIRPLANE WE CAN TOP THE outboard WITH LESS THAN _ PEOPLE AND STILL BE UNDER grossweight.I PUT IN A FUEL ORDER FOR THE nextflight IN THE AIR standardoperatingprocedure top outboard.AFTER get ON THE ground AND get MY PAPERWORK FOR THE nextflight I proceed OUT TO THE aircraft TO DEPART.I ask THE firstofficer IF WE GOT fuel AND HE acknowledge YES.THE takeoff AND climb WERE UNEVENTFUL UNTIL I glance OVER AT THE fuelgauge AFTER takeoff.I SAW ONLY ABOUT _ pound onboard.AFTER determine THAT WE depart WITH JUST ENOUGH minimumfuel I continue.AFTER determine THAT THE wind ALOFT WERE show A LESS HEADWIND THAN WHAT WAS actual SHOWN I decide TO MAKE A land AT LARAMIE TO GET MORE FUEL DUE TO THE increase headwind SHOWN.THE REST OF THE NIGHT WAS UNEVENTFUL.I BELIEVE THAT FUTURE problem LIKE THIS COULD BE solve IF WHEN go overfuel QUANTITY IN OUR checklist IT SHOULD BE CHALLENGE respond VERSUS VERBAL respond SO THAT BOTH crewmember ACKNOWLEDGE FUEL AND MINIMUM need.

293~I depart CTS WITH A fuelstop plan AT gai airport.normal I TURN MY transpond ON altitude AT startup.HOWEVER BECAUSE I WAS IN classb AIRSPACE AT STARTUP I LEFT IT AT STANDBY I HAD READ TO DO THIS TO REDUCE congest ON SCOPE.I MAY HAVE fly ON STANDBY FROM CGS TO gai airport.UPON RESTART AT gai airport I DID DEPART ON STANDBY.I realize THE problem DURING flight AND immediate switch transpond TO altitude.
294~WHILE begin TO leveloff AT _ feetmeansealevel firstofficer handfly THE aircraft ON AN assign _ degree head AND _ knot ZNY GAVE A clearance TO flightlevel AND INTERCEPT airway.captain SET altitudewindow TO flightlevel WE BOTH point AND state _ AND setup flightmanagementsystem TO INTERCEPT airway AT PARKE.captain ALSO readback TO airtrafficcontrol climb TO flightlevel AND airway.pass _ feet ZNY TOLD US TO LEVEL AT _ feet THEN state THAT OUR clearance HAD actual BEEN TO FLY head _ degree AND INTERCEPT airway.THIS EVENT WAS cause BY MISCOM misunderstand.THE ZNY control MAY HAVE MISSPOKEN hi instruct AND OR THE captain AND firstofficer OF aircraft X misunderstand hear hi word.I CAN SAY THAT THE COCKPIT WAS QUIET NO converse DUE TO THE WORKLOAD IN THE NEW YORK AREA.THE headset WERE ON jumpseat onboard WITH firstofficer south SPEAKER UP.bottomline THERE IS NO communicate UNTIL THERE IS understand.IF THE captain south READBACK WAS differ THAN THE control south intent THEN IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN correct RIGHT THEN.AIM STANDARD term MUST BE us IE leave altitude AND climb TO altitude.control SHOULD HAVE correct SIT soon.control SHOULD ONLY BE require TO WORK _ frequency.readback ARE import AND THEY SHOULD BE listen TO.ALSO IF YOU ARE jumpseat PAY attention AND HELP OUT IF YOU CAN.
295~AT _ feet AN aircraft airduct explode IN COCKPIT.THIS cause EXTREME NOISE AND ALSO blow aircraft YELLOW insulate THROUGHOUT THE COCKPIT.THIS disrupt COCKPIT AND airtrafficcontrol communicate.AN emergency WAS declare AND A RETURN TO PIT WAS accomplish.oxygenmask WERE NOT PUT TO us BECAUSE BOTH flight crewmember WERE cough DUE TO THE insulate IN THE cockpitenvironment.A QUICK RETURN TO POINT OF depart WAS THE onlysolution._ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ THE report state THE aircraft WAS A _.THE report say THE aircondition DUCT separate occur UNDER THE COCKPIT FLOOR AND BEHIND THE low left instrumentpanel shower fiberglass insulate THROUGHOUT THE COCKPIT.THE report say THE oxygenmask WERE USELESS AS THE fiberglass WAS IN THE mask.THE report say maintain advise THE CAUSE WAS OVERPRESSURE OF THE left PACK BLEED AIR BY THE engine mount PRESSURE REGULATOR AND shutoffvalve.
296~IN SUM AIRLINE CREW us STANDARD RADAR procedure automaticterminalinformationservice retrieve AND VISUAL observe IN prepare FOR approach.THEIR determine WAS THAT IT WOULD BE A NORMAL arrive WITH NO APPARENT hazard.passenger WERE seat AND flightattendant WERE complete safe check WHEN aircraft enter A LAYER OF scatteredcloud AT _ feet.turbulent WAS encounter AND firstflight attend report on OF HER CREW WAS injure.CREW request slow speed AND delay approach TO check STATUS OF INJURY WHICH WAS provide BY airtrafficcontrol.paramedic WERE request.INJURY WAS TO THE ANKLE OF crewmember.turbulent WAS NOT report previous AND airtrafficcontrol WAS UNAWARE OF IT.follow aircraft WERE NOT affect BECAUSE OF THE report THIS CREW MADE.
297~WE WERE approach OAK airport AND THE currentautomaticterminalinformationservice WAS report THE FIELD TO THE _ feet overcast AND _ mile visible AND THE glideslope FOR runway _ WAS report TO BE inoperative.THIS WOULD PUT THE ceil approximate _ feet BELOW OUR minimum FOR THE exist runway condition.OUR OTHER alternate WAS TO us runway WHICH IS _ feet WHICH I consider TO BE ADEQUATE BUT NEVERTHELESS A shorterrunway THAN WE ARE us TO us.minimum FOR runway ARE _ feet AND _ mile visible AND WE WERE inform THAT WE WOULD BE us runway AS HAD OTHER carrier.I brief THE firstofficer ON THE approach TO runway BUT AFTER sever minute HAD elapse AND A handoff TO BAY approach WE WERE inform THAT THE runway WOULD NOW BE runway _.WE check automaticterminalinformationservice ONLY TO GET THE SAME weather WE HAD BEFORE IE _ feet overcast AND _ mile visible.WE THEN call tower AND WERE inform THAT THE ceil WAS NOW _ feet overcast.THIS WAS A lastminute CHANGE FOR US WHILE be vector FOR THE approach TO runway _.WE WERE HIGH FOR THE PROFILE DUE TO airtrafficcontrol traffic AND THEREBY HAD TO REMAIN AT altitude AND IT prevent OUR NORMAL descend.IN add TO THIS approach WAS turn US CLOSE TO THE finalapproachfix compound OUR problem OF THE NEED FOR A high THAN NORMAL descend RATE.WE WERE clear FOR THE approach TO runway _ WHEN establish ON THE locate.AT THIS POINT I incorrect select glideslope ON THE MCP.THE aircraft capture A falseglideslope AND begin descend.AT FIRST THE RATE OF descend appear NORMAL BUT AS WE approach THE FIX I COULD SEE THAT IT WAS INDEED TOO HIGH A RATE OF descend.I THEN disconnect THE autopilot AND handfly THE approach.DURING THIS TIME OF BRIEF confuse I realize THAT I MIGHT BE AT AN altitude THAT WAS low THAN call FOR.I query THE firstofficer AS TO WHAT THE altitude WAS suppose TO BE BUT DID NOT HEAR A respond.WHEN I WAS ABLE TO crosscheck THE altitude I verify THAT I WAS TOO LOW.I BELIEVE THIS WAS ABOUT _ feetmeansealevel AT ABOUT _ mile PRIOR TO THE finalapproachfix.I begin TO CORRECT BUT BY THE TIME THIS occur I WAS AT THE finalapproachfix AND minimum FOR US WERE _ feetmeansealevel.I therefor continue TO HOLD THIS altitude AND IT WAS AT THIS POINT INSIDE THE finalapproachfix THAT approachcontrol OR tower I M NOT SURE WHICH AT THIS POINT call lowaltitude ALERT.I THEN query THE firstofficer AGAIN AS TO THE CORRECT altitude AND HE verify THAT _ feetmeansealevel WAS CORRECT FOR INSIDE THE finalapproachfix.WE BROKE OUT ON SCHEDULE AND land uneventful.I feel THE lastminute CHANGE OF runway BOTH WITH margin set OF condition EACH differ IN it OWN WAY contribute TO THE confuse DURING THE highrate OF descend AND THE EVENTUAL CAPTURE OF A falseglideslope.I FEEL THAT I select THE glideslope UNDER THE IDEA THAT I WAS us runway FOR A BRIEF MOMENT THEN realize MY ERROR try TO CORRECT FOR THE altitude WHEN MY ERROR WAS realize.
298~numerousaircraft HAVE BEEN report THE glideslope AS vary.aircraft TODAY report glideslope UNUSABLE.THIS HAS BEEN go ON FOR AT LEAST _ week.

304~ON baseleg TO runway AT atl airport _ degree INTERCEPT ANGLE.I WAS pilotflying.THERE WAS A SQUEAL ON THE approach frequency THAT WENT UNANSWERED.approximate _ second LATER AS WE WERE start TO INTERCEPT THE locate NOT YET clear FOR ani TYPE OF approach approachcontrol ask US IF WE WERE intercept.captain reply affirm AND TOLD ME TO BANK IT ON OVER.I execute A _ degree BANK BUT STILL WAS NOT ABLE TO INTERCEPT BEFORE cross INTO THE approach PATH FOR runway.WE WERE THEN clear FOR A VISUAL approach.complicate factor WERE _ atl airport approach keep aircraft ON A VERY TIGHT DOWNWIND AND BASE WHICH leave LITTLE ROOM FOR ERROR OR MISCOM._ THIS WAS OUR LAST AND FINAL OF _ CONSECUTIVE standups reduce REST overnight AND WE WERE BOTH tire AND EAGER TO GET HOME._ IT WAS haze ENOUGH OUTSIDE TO PREVENT see THE airport clear FROM _ mile OUT BUT STILL clear ENOUGH TO ISSUE VISUAL approach.I FEEL THAT approachcontrol need TO GIVE A slight large DOWNWIND AT atl airport AND need TO REALIZE THAT A largejet SHOULDN T STAY ON A _ degree INTERCEPT FOR LONG.IF THEY WOULD JUST TAKE US A FEW mile FURTHER OUT THEY COULD ISSUE THE followingclearance AND BE DONE WITH IT.suggest XXX TURN left head _ degree INTERCEPT THE runway locate report airport IN SIGHT.THIS WOULD ELIMINATE THE KIND OF problem WE encounter.
305~clear INBOUND ON MITTS standardterminalarrivalroute TO north COMPLEX AT lax airport._ approach ask US THAT WE HAD A heavyjet THAT WOULD JOIN THE CIVET arrive TO THE south COMPLEX.WE report IT IN SIGHT AND WE WERE TOLD TO MAINTAIN visualseparation AND give A loweraltitude ALONG THE standardterminalarrivalroute.WE pass BY THE heavyjet WHICH WAS turn FROM A baseleg TO JOIN THE standardterminalarrivalroute AND short THEREAFTER WE receive A trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _ resolutionadvisory FOR THE heavyjet WHICH WAS AT OUR _ o'clock posit HIGH AND descend.IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO JUDGE THE rang TO THE heavy visual trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _ show IT TO BE LESS THAN _ mile.WE comply WITH THE resolutionadvisory BY descend BELOW THE prescribe altitude PROFILE ON THE standardterminalarrivalroute.WE advise _ approach THAT WE HAD comply WITH THE resolutionadvisory.THE respond WAS A DISINTERESTED YOU HAVE HIM IN SIGHT DON T YOU.AN OVERSHOOT OF THE CIVET standardterminalarrivalroute BY THE OTHER aircraft MAY HAVE occur lead TO THE trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _ resolutionadvisory.visualseparation AT NIGHT IS UNSAFE.BUT WOE BE TO THE pilot WHO doe NOT ACCEPT IT go INTO lax airport.THE control WILL DENY low altitude AND approach clearance TO AN aircraft NOT wish TO ACCEPT visualseparation.
306~OUR flight WAS clear FOR takeoffrunway AT phl airport.I WAS THE pilotflying.AFTER advance THE THRUST lever TO TOGA I remove MY HAND AND THE captain assume maintain control OF THE THRUST lever AS IS NORMAL standardoperatingprocedure.between approximate _ knot WE GOT AN AMBER mastercautionlight AND momentary AN ECAM MESSAGE navigate FM GPS posit disagree.SINCE THE ECAM IS suppose TO INHIBIT THE warn caution WHICH ARE NOT PARAMOUNT IE FIRE fail FROM _ knot TO _ feetabovegroundlevel OR _ minute AFTER LIFTOFF WHICHEVER occur FIRST THE captain MADE THE DECISION TO REJECT THE takeoff.AFTER stop THE aircraft AND THEN clear THE runway WE try TO FIGURE OUT WHAT ECAM MESSAGE HAD occur SINCE IT WAS NO long display.WE call companymaintenance AND discuss WHAT happen WITH THEM.WE WERE TOLD AS LONG AS THERE WERE NO ECAM message STILL display AND THERE WEREN T WE WERE OK TO CONTINUE OUR flight.WE wait UNTIL OUR brake cool TO THE require temperature THEN continue uneventful TO OUR destinate.
307~WE WERE switchedover TO depart control WHO instruct US TO TURN right TO A _ degree head AND WHEN ABLE TO PROCEED TO THE sjc airport veryhighfrequencyomnidirectionalradiorange AND CROSS THE veryhighfrequencyomnidirectionalradiorange AT _ feet OR ABOVE AND climb TO flightlevel.AT ABOUT THE TIME WE cross THE veryhighfrequencyomnidirectionalradiorange WE WERE instruct TO CONTACT ZOA.UPON CONTACT WITH ZOA WE HAD cross THE veryhighfrequencyomnidirectionalradiorange AND WERE AT AROUND _ feet.THE ZOA control ask WHAT OUR clearance WAS TO CROSS THE sjc airport veryhighfrequencyomnidirectionalradiorange.I TOLD HIM PROCEED TO THE veryhighfrequencyomnidirectionalradiorange AND CROSS THE veryhighfrequencyomnidirectionalradiorange AT ABOVE _ feet AND climb TO flightlevel.HE say THAT WE WERE suppose TO CROSS THE veryhighfrequencyomnidirectionalradiorange AT _ feet AND THEN climb TO flightlevel.I MUST HAVE misunderstand THE control AND THOUGHT THE clearance WAS TO CROSS THE veryhighfrequencyomnidirectionalradiorange AT ABOVE _ feet AND climb TO flightlevel.THE ZOA control THEN say THAT clearance IS SOMETIMES give BUT NOT IN THIS CASE.THE ACTUAL print standardinstrumentdeparture doe REQUIRE YOU TO CROSS THE veryhighfrequencyomnidirectionalradiorange AT _ feet.IF THE control want US TO CROSS THE veryhighfrequencyomnidirectionalradiorange AT _ feet WHY NOT SAY FOLLOW THE publishedstandardinstrumentdeparture AND THEN climb AND MAINTAIN flightlevel.IT seem THAT WOULD HAVE MADE MORE SENSE AND WOULD HAVE CUT DOWN ON ani misunderstand concern cross altitude.
308~AFTER _ takeoff AND land WE WERE start OUR _ LEG FROM _.THE LAST _ leg WERE WITH AN aircraft WITH AN inoperativeauxiliarypowerunit.early IN hou airport WE HAD problem WITH THE airstart UNIT AND ONCE AGAIN A problem.WE RAN OUR checklist AND ask FOR AIR BUT THE UNIT WOULD NOT START SO OUR ground PEOPLE WENT TO FIND A NEW ground START UNIT.WE turn THE anticollision lightoff AS WE WERE UNABLE TO START THE engine.IT WAS HOT OUTSIDE AND SOON THE aircraft WAS get HOT INSIDE WITH _ plus passenger.AFTER MUCH confuse THE ground PEOPLE bring A NEW UNIT TO START THE engine.IN A HURRY TO START AND GET aircondition TO US AND THE passenger MY firstofficer forget TO TURN THE anticollision LIGHT BACK ON AND WE start THE engine AND taxi WITHOUT THE anticollision LIGHT ON.I ONLY notice THIS AFTER takeoff AS I check THE land light AND notice THE LIGHT WAS OFF.I THEN turn THE anticollision LIGHT BACK ON.I WOULD GUESS THE combine OF HEAT AND confuse ON THE RAMP cause US TO MISS THE LIGHT.OUR procedure ON THE BEFORE START checklist IS THAT IT IS DONE silent BY THE firstofficer AS HE check ductpressure AND anticollision LIGHT.THAT SILENT checklist allow ME NOT TO BACK HIM UP.
309~IT WAS HARD instrumentmeteorologicalconditions FROM LDJ TO _ airport CXY AT HARRISBURG PA.I WAS AT _ feetmeansealevel south OF THE approach rout AND begin TO BE concern ABOUT THE descend BECAUSE OF proximity WHEN THE approach control TOLD ME THAT BECAUSE OF THE close HE WOULD BRING ME DOWN THROUGH THE locate AND THEN BACK IN TO THE locate FROM THE left.come BACK TO THE locate IT DID NOT SEEM TO BE center AND JUST AS IT WAS center BUT BEFORE I COULD INFORM THE control THE control cancel THE approach TOLD ME TO climb BACK TO _ feet AND GAVE ME vector TO DO IT AGAIN WITH WHICH I comply.ON THE approach THE secondtime I advise THE control THAT I WAS NOT acquire THE glideslope.I THEN hear ANOTHER pilot tell THE control THE samething.I DID NOT FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE OR stress BUT I DID SAY TO THE control THAT I COULD us ALL THE HELP I COULD GET.AT THAT POINT OTHER pilot say THAT FROM THE outermarker HE descend AT _ FPM AND BROKE OUT ABOUT _ feet OR _ feet.THE control THEN say THIS CHANNEL IS FOR traffic control IN EFFORT chastise THE OTHER pilot.IN MY OPINION UNDER THE circumstance THE OTHER pilot contribute substantial TO MY safe.AFTER break INTO visualflightrules AT ABOUT _ feet AND look FOR THE runway I WAS TOLD lowaltitude ALERT.I WAS THEN AT ABOUT _ feet WHICH IS BELOW THE _ feet MINIMUM FOR instrumentflightrules.I M NOT SURE THE control know I WAS OUT OF THE cloud AT THAT MOMENT.I acknowledge AND climb TO between _ feet TO KEEP HIM HAPPY.THE runway quick appear AND I land.
310~ON approach TO land SAW A DEER ON runway initiate A goaraound AND circle BACK FOR A land AFTER DEER depart runway.

317~accomplish day check AND ON right engine I notice NO OIL IN SIGHT GAUGE AND remove CAP AND check OIL WITH DIPSTICK AND reinstall CAP AND lock IT DOWN.MY LEAD watch ME check OIL AND install OF CAP.AFTER BREAK THE PLANE WAS take TO runuppad FOR automate pack SHUTDOWN.IT fail TEST AND VALUE WAS replace AND return TO PAD FOR A SECOND RUN.DAYLIGHT SHIFT continue WITH THE REPAIR AND release IT FOR serve AND place ON THE GATE FOR flight.aircraft dispatch TO ORD.UPON arrive AT GATE OIL WAS FOUND LOW AND CAP FOUND LOOSE.
318~I AM relative NEW TO flightmanagementcomputer automate flight AND therefor DID NOT REACT FAST ENOUGH TO AN automate fail THAT produce AN altitudedeviation UPON LEVELOFF.I HAD select maximumrate climb ON THE flightmanagementcomputer UPON A center REQUEST FOR goodrate.WHILE climb THROUGH ABOUT flightlevel FOR flightlevel I observe airspeed fall OFF FROM THE maximumrate COMMAND BUG AT A rapidrate.NOSE WAS ALSO pitch UP.WE manage TO REACH flightlevel BUT AT A VERY LOW ENERGY STATE WITH BUFFET warn annunciate ON THE engineindicationandcrewalertingsystem DISPLAY.PRIOR TO reach THIS CONDITION I WAS involve IN reselect THE climb PAGE WITH A VIEW TO REINSTATING ECONOMY climb ON THE flightmanagementcomputer.HOWEVER THE aircraft need immediateattention DUE TO THE rapid OF THE ENERGY LOSS.I WAS INTENT OF reduce PITCH RIGHT AWAY SO I disengage THE autopilot TO ESTABLISH MANUAL flight.automate followup PITCH TRIM HAD NOT YET HAD TIME TO CATCH UP TO THE NEW LOW ENERGY STATE AND SO I WAS immediate present WITH STRONG NOSE DOWN PITCH force.THIS cause THE NOSE TO DROP A LITTLE MORE THAN I HAD plan OR WOULD HAVE desire AND altitude decrease TO ABOUT flightlevel AGAIN.THIS WAS NOT necessary A BAD THING aerodynamic speak HOWEVER I AM AWARE THAT center WAS oblige TO ISSUE AN avoidancevector TO ANOTHER CARRIER AT THE TIME.A FACTOR IN THIS INCIDENT WAS MY relate slow UPON observe THE airspeed DECREASE AND pitchup IN select climb PAGE IN ORDER TO INSTITUTE A FIX.I THINK I WAS momentary transfix BY THE PHENOMENON OF THE airspeed NEEDLE JUST drop OFF THE COMMAND BUG AND drop FAST.IT JUST WASN T suppose TO DO THAT.BY THE TIME I HAD ASSIMILATED THIS inform AND integrate IT WE HAD gain ANOTHER _ feet AND THE aircraft NOW need immediateattention.THIS WAS A FIRST FOR ME IN THIS aircraft TO OBSERVE THE autopilot ALL OF A SUDDEN START ignore AN flightmanagementcomputer COMMAND AND GO OFF ON it OWN WITH NO OTHER fail indication.supplementalinformation FROM airborneclassificationnumber _ WHILE climb TO flightlevel THE captain WHO WAS fly observe airspeed BEGIN TO DECREASE pass flightlevel.THE autopilot WAS ignore THE flightmanagementsystem command airspeed OF _ knot AND raise THE PITCH.THE flightmanagementsystem WAS direct A maximumrate climb AT THE TIME.THE captain disconnect THE autopilot TO REGAIN airspeed AND THE aircraft descend FROM flightlevel TO approximateflightlevel WHERE airspeed begin TO RECOVER.AT THIS TIME I DO NOT KNOW WHY THE autopilot ignore THE flightmanagementcomputer AND begin reduce airspeed.THE altitudeloss WAS A RESULT OF THE lowairspeed AND THE NEED TO RECOVER IT ABOVE A SAFE BUFFET MARGIN.I COULD HAVE improve THE SIT BY recognize THE airspeedloss soon AND bring IT TO THE captain south attention.BETTER crewresourcemanagement need ON MY PART.
319~clearance WAS DIRECT TO MYTON veryhighfrequencyomnidirectionalradiorange.airtrafficcontrol call US AND query OUR rout DIRECT TO MYTON.WE refer horizontalsituationindicator WHICH show head WAS _ degree OFF FROM MYTON.AS BEST WE COULD TELL THE REASON FOR THE head ERROR WAS cause BY leave THE autopilot TURN KNOB slight OUT OF THE NEUTRAL DETENT.THE _ degree BANK WAS NOT notice AND THE head ERROR slow occur.
320~ON september _ OUR CREW WAS approach BY AN onboard supervise WHO WAS ALSO A flightattendant ABOUT allow HER TO OCCUPY THE cockpitjumpseat SO HER CABIN SEAT COULD BE us FOR nonrevenue SPACE avail passenger.THE captain say NO HE WOULD PREFER SHE TOOK HER assign SEAT AS THERE WAS ANOTHER flightattendant WHO WOULD ALSO LIKE TO jumpseat.THE onboard supervise THEN ON HER OWN bring THE OTHER flightattendant TO THE COCKPIT.THE custom serve represent close THE DOOR AND WE carry A companyflight attend TO LONDON.WE WERE UNAWARE THIS WAS NOT allow SINCE WE HAD carry OTHER flightattendant FOR familiar ride.THE SOLUTION TO THE problem ABOVE WAS TO NOT HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE involve IN A SIT.great KNOWLEDGE OF companyprocedure WOULD ALSO BE help.ALSO THE FACT THAT MANY item include this situate happen IN THE LAST _ minute PRIOR TO depart.this situate probable COULD HAVE BEEN avoid IF decision ON board WERE MADE early.
321~WHILE descend INBOUND TO BFM AND UNDER THE control OF ZHU WAS give clearance TO PROCEED DIRECT TO BFM veryhighfrequencyomnidirectionalradiorange descend TO _ feetmeansealevel clear FOR instrumentlandingsystem _ approach TO BFM.approximate _ nauticalmile northeast OF BROOKLY BFM ZHU TOLD US TO SWITCH TO BFM tower.UPON report TO BFM tower AND report THE FIELD IN SIGHT BFM tower TOLD US TO report right BASE FOR A VISUAL TO runway _ AT BFM.AT approximate _ nauticalmile FROM BFM veryhighfrequencyomnidirectionalradiorange WE start A SLOW left TURN TO parallelrunway _ AND enter A right DOWNWIND FOR A VISUAL approach AND land TO runway _ BFM.LEVEL AT _ feetmeansealevel AND ABEAM approach END OF runway _ WE start turn BASE WHEN BFM tower TOLD US TO CONTACT ZHU.WE switch BACK TO ZHU WHO ask US WHERE WE WERE go.ZHU control say WE WERE TOO FAR east AND TOO LOW.firstofficer execute A goaraound visualflightrules AND WE switch BACK TO tower WHO GAVE US A left DOWNWIND FOR A VISUAL approach TO runway _.WE land WITH NO FURTHER problem.conclude FIRST OF ALL I DON T THINK WE DID ANYTHING WRONG.second I BELIEVE IT WAS INAPPROPRIATE FOR ZHU TO HAVE US CONTACT HIM WHILE IN THE approach MODE.THIS IS A safe OF flight SIT.IF ZHU HAD A problem WITH US HE SHOULD HAVE give US A LANDLINE phonenumber.
322~WE WERE clear AS follow descend _ feet profiledescent.THIS WAS unclear TO US BECAUSE THE PROFILE require AN INTERMEDIATE STOP ON THE WAY TO _ feet.I query THE control TO ASK IF HE want US TO FLY THE PROFILE OR descend TO _ feet.THE respond WAS _ feet PROFILE.therefor WE start A descend TO _ feet follow THE horizontal COURSE PROFILE.WHEN WE cross THE yyz airport _ distancemeasuringequipment AT approximate _ feet THE control ask US WHY WE WEREN T AT _ feet PER THE PROFILE.I respond THAT I understand OUR clearance AS be descend TO _ feet follow THE PROFILE.HE say NO.IN MY OPINION THIS confuse SIT COULD BE avoid BY THE clearance be issue AS simple FLY profiledescent OMIT THE _ feet discuss.AFTER speak WITH OTHER LINE pilot.I discover THIS IS A VERY commonoccurrence.
323~THUD NOISE note UNDER AND BEHIND COCKPIT ON descend INTO lax airport.NOISE WAS research BY lax airport groundpersonnel AND maintain document THAT THE FIRST _ forwardcargo contain IN THE forwardcargo HOLD WERE NOT REPEAT NOT secure.THESE contain WERE LOOSE AND slide FORWARD AND AFT IN THE HOLD.I CONSIDER IT A SERIOUS SIT AND OURSELVES FORTUNATE THAT THE HOLD WAS FULL TO THE EXTENT THAT THE contain DID NOT SLIDE TO THE REAR OF THE HOLD.HAD THEY DONE THAT I AM NOT SURE WHAT detriment effect THAT WOULD HAVE HAD ON OUR centerofgravity AT takeoff rotate.
324~DUE TO AN enginefire inflight WHICH result IN AN emergency land THE captain WHO WAS THE pilotnotflying decide HE WILL CONTINUE TO DO pilotnotflyingduty DURING THE REST OF THE flight.EVEN THOUGH memoryitem AND enginefire inflight checklist WERE accomplish THE REST OF THE singleengine operate checklist WAS accomplish silent AND CANNOT RECALL IF ANYTHING WAS say TO THAT RESPECT.HOWEVER ALL item WERE DONE EXCEPT ON THE PART OF brief THE APPROPRIATE VREF speed DURING OR pertain TO THE singleengine PROFILE.captain recall advise pilotflying firstofficer ABOUT maintain A SPECIFIC airspeed PRIOR TO land AND THAT IT WAS WELL ABOVE MINIMUM specify ON checklist.BUT NO MENTION ON accomplish checklist verbal.ALSO AFTER land AND SINCE FIRE WAS OUT BEFORE TOUCHDOWN captain request firechief TO ADVISE ON WHETHER OR NOT TO TAXI TO THE RAMP WHICH HE accept AND A NORMAL deplane OF passenger WAS DONE.NO on WAS injure._ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ THE report state THE FIRST warn receive WAS AN ACRID ODOR follow BY THE right engine lowoilpressure warn AND _ second LATER THE enginefirewarning ALARM AND light.THE report say THE CAUSE WAS A compress CASE BORESCOPE PLUG NOT secure allow THE combine OF HOT BLEED AIR AND engineoil TO MIX.THE report state THE engine WAS replace DUE TO FIRE DAMAGE.

362~A DENT WAS FOUND ON THE leadingedge OF THE lefthand number _ SLAT ON A LINE check.IT WAS inspect AND determine TO BE WITHIN limit PER manage south instruct ON measure procedure.AFTER FURTHER REVIEW IT HAS BEEN determine THAT BOTH THE measure AND procedure WERE INCORRECT.
363~ON september _ I WAS inform AT _ THE left nosegear WHEEL AND TIRE assemble THAT I replace ON _ aircraft NOSE XYZ ON september _ AT approximate _ WAS THE WRONG PART NUMBER FOR _ aircraft._ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ THE report state THE _ HAS THE TIRE VENT plug THAT ARE differ THAN THE _ SERIES.THE COMPANY HAS NOW standard THE PART number AND THE WHEEL AND TIRE assembly ARE NOW INTERCHANGEABLE.
364~DURING instrumentlandingsystem approach runway TO lax airport IN instrumentmeteorologicalconditions ABOUT _ mile IN TRAIL OF A _ WE encounter _ success waketurbulence encounter WITHIN A timespan OF _ second.THE FIRST ENCOUNTER PUT US IN _ degree BANK WITH oppose control INPUT be apply.WE realize WE WERE IN SOMEONE south WAKE AND fly HIGH ON glideslope.EVEN THEN WE receive _ addition roll WHICH WERE quick correct.WE THEN advise BOTH local AND FINAL MONITOR control THAT WE WERE slow FURTHER TO INCREASE space.THESE encounter occur AT altitude FROM _ feet TO _ feetmeansealevel.SUBSEQUENT land UNEVENTFUL.
365~AIRBUS _ AT glideslope INTERCEPT WENT TO flap _ degree.A SUDDEN windgust cause THE aircraft TO ACCELERATE rapid AND fast THAN THE autopilot OR autothrottle COULD RESPOND AND DESPITE disengage THE autopilot.raise THE PITCH AND retard THE throttle TO IDLE.WE continue TO INCREASE speed TO THE POINT THAT flap _ degree LIMIT speed WAS exceed BY _ knot FOR _ second.THERE WAS NO correspond windshear like DECREASE IN airspeed.THE flight continue TO A NORMAL land.automaticterminalinformationservice wind WERE _ degree AT _ knot gust TO _ knot.THIS INCIDENT WAS INADVERTENT.followup WITH maintain indicate NO aircraftdamage.I FEEL THAT OUR train IS ADEQUATE TO COVER MOST SITS LIKE THIS.
366~WHEN assign TO TAPE CABIN floorboard WITH FIRE TAPE ME AND MY FELLOW WORKER HAD A discuss ABOUT IF THE board ARE TO BE seal UNDER THE TAPE OR NOT.WELL COME TO FIND OUT PER maintain MANUAL THAT THEY CAN BE seal ON THE FORWARD AND AFT end WITH JUST TAPE.HOWEVER THE edge OF THE BOARD WHERE THEY CONTACT THE FLOOR beam OR SEAT track ARE suppose TO BE seal WITH SEALANT.THE board THAT ARE NEW ARE ALSO suppose TO BE tape ON ALL edge BEFORE THE BOARD IS install.I WAS TOLD BY THE crewchief THAT THEY DIDN T NEED TO BE seal OR tape AND THAT SOME PAPERWORK SOMEWHERE wayback WHEN say WE DIDN T HAVE TO DO IT THAT WAY.SO WE HAVE DONE THIS FOR numerousaircraft AND I HAVE BEEN ON THE DOCK SINCE _.I KNOW THAT I AND THE major OF THE CREW HAS install board THAT SHOULD BE tape AND seal depend ON THE BOARD locate.I DON T KNOW IF THERE IS PAPERWORK SOMEWHERE THAT state IT IS OK TO INSTALL board IN THIS MANNER OR NOT AND WHAT safe CONDITION THIS COULD CAUSE.
367~DURING A descend INTO grr airport WE WERE clear TO descend TO _ feet._ feet WAS SET IN THE altitudeselector AND arm ON THE autopilot control PANEL.short AFTER THIS WE WERE hand OFF TO grr airport approach.AT THIS TIME MY firstofficer report TO ME THAT HE HAD THE FIELD IN SIGHT.I THEN begin look FOR THE airport.WHEN I look BACK IN THE COCKPIT WE WERE descend THROUGH _ feet.THE altitude ALERT LIGHT ON THE ALTIMETER WAS light HOWEVER THE altitudearm LIGHT WAS STILL ON ON THE autopilot control PANEL AND THE autopilot DID NOT CAPTURE THE altitude.AT THIS POINT I disengage THE autopilot AND immediate climb BACK TO _ feet.totaltime OFF altitude WAS ABOUT _ second.ONCE BACK AT _ feet THE firstofficer call grr airport approach.grr airport THEN GAVE US A descend TO THE airport AND DID NOT QUESTION ani deviate.I BELIEVE THE contribute factor WERE THE autopilot south fail TO CAPTURE THE altitude ALONG WITH MY fail TO MONITOR THE automate AS WE WERE approach THE assignedaltitude.IN THE FUTURE I WILL MONITOR THE automate MORE close EVEN IN visualmeteorologicalconditions.particular WHEN approach assign altitude AND head.IF I wish TO LOOK FOR THE airport I SHOULD HAVE THE firstofficer MONITOR THE instrument.THIS procedure IS us ON instrument approach BUT SHOULD ALSO BE us DURING visualcondition.
368~I HAD A problem relate TO sunglare WHILE land INTO A SUNSET.AROUND _ localtime I land ON runway _ AT cdw airport.I touch DOWN WITH _ degree OF flap.WHILE hold THE NOSEWHEEL OFF THE runway THE sunglare MADE THE runway APPEAR short IN LENGTH THAN IT actual WAS.fear THE worse I lower THE NOSEWHEEL TO THE runway AND brake AS HARD AS POSSIBLE.HARD brake result IN A FLAT TIRE lower THE NOSEWHEEL reduce THE AMOUNT OF GLARE.immediate I SAW THAT THERE WAS suffice runway IN FRONT OF ME FOR THE land AND THAT I HAD apply TOO MUCH BRAKE TO STOP THE aircraft.I continue TO DECELERATE AND try TO EXIT THE runway AT taxiway B.I manage TAXI AS FAR AS THE runway hold posit mark.I report TO THE groundcontrol THAT THE aircraft HAD A FLAT TIRE.HE confirm THAT THE right MAIN TIRE appear FLAT AND ask ME TO TAXI ACROSS THE hold posit mark.I TOLD HIM THAT I WAS UNABLE TO TAXI ani FARTHER.HE say THAT HE WAS send airport operate.airtrafficcontrol THEN closedrunway _.TO PREVENT THIS FROM happen I WILL REQUEST runway _ WHILE land LATE IN THE DAY AT cdw airport.IF THIS runway IS NOT avail I WILL LAND AT ANOTHER airport IN THE AREA.
369~ON approach INTO NEW BERN NC FROM rdu airport I WAS fly MY captain WAS workingradio AND OTHER pilotnotflyingduty.WE descend THROUGH A broke LAYER OF cloud TO LOOK FOR THE airport.airtrafficcontrol say TO EXPECT THE VISUAL.WE HAD THE locate tune identify.WE BROKE OUT TO SEE THE FIELD.ABOUT _ mile AWAY WE realize WE WERE look AT cherrypoint marinecorpsairstation.WE turn AWAY AND proceed TO EWN uneventful.I FEEL THAT expect THE VISUAL approach WE WOULD SEE THE FIELD AS SOON AS WE BROKE OUT.WHEN WE BROKE OUT WE SAW AN airport AND presume IT WAS our.WE HAD BEEN give sever vector FOR space BEHIND A FALCON JET AND I THINK WE LOST SPATIAL aware BECAUSE WE switch THE navigate radio FROM veryhighfrequencyomnidirectionalradiorange TO locate.THE SIT WAS FURTHER complicate WHEN airtrafficcontrol cancel OUR instrumentflightrulesflight PLAN.WE say WE WOULD CANCEL ON THE ground OR ON FINAL AND THEY misunderstand.WE WERE reidentified AND NO OTHER complicate arise.situationalawareness AND airtrafficcontrol confuse lead TO THIS EVENT BUT GOOD CREW coordinate ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND MY captain lead TO A problem FREE CONTINUATION OF flight.supplementalinformation FROM airborneclassificationnumber _ WE realize WE WERE fly TOWARD cherrypoint marinecorpsairstation BY A crosscheck OF NAVAIDS.WE attempt radiocontact WITH cherrypoint approachcontrol sever time BEFORE CONTACT WAS establish AND WE turn TOWARD NEW BERN airport.this situate WAS PRECIPITATED BY MY PREFIGURING takeoffperformance DATA IN prepare FOR A quickturnaround.nexttime I LL PAY MORE attention TO THE IMMEDIATE duty AT HAND.
370~pilotflying STUDENT firstofficer pilotnotflying check AIRMAN.I demonstrate TO THE STUDENT firstofficer A climbout OF bos airport us perform MODE ON THE PMS WITH THE autopilot DFGS.AT THE TOP OF climb I SET CRUISE IN THE PMS AT MACH _ AS WAS THE desire CRUISE MACH ON THE flight PLAN.AS THE flight approach THE NEW YORK AREA I decide TO INCREASE OUR indicatedairspeed TO _ knot TO CONFORM TO arrivaltraffic INTO jfk airport.I DID NOT INPUT _ knot INTO THE PMS INSTEAD I SET _ knot IN THE DFGS.THE altitude ALERT sound AT flightlevel.I correct THE altitudedeviation AND return TO flightlevel.I BELIEVE THAT input THE speed CHANGE IN THE DFGS THUS disengage THE PMS cause THE altitudedeviation.WHEN select perform MODE WILL OPERATE plus or minus _ feet THE desire flightlevel.IF perform MODE IS disengage WHILE IN A SLIGHT descend THE descend WILL CONTINUE UNTIL correct.THE LESSON learn IS TO check AND crosscheck THE flightmodeannunciator WHEN manipulate THE DFGS special WHEN us perform MODE.
371~WHEN accomplish A TIME CHANGE ON A tailcone evacuate SLIDE AN inspect ITEM WAS inadvertent omit.replace OF THE TAIL SLIDE WAS assign ON september _ AS PART OF A WORK PACKAGE WHICH MADE NO refer TO follow A JOB procedure CARD WHICH WAS avail ALTHOUGH AT THE TIME I WAS UNAWARE OF THIS avail.JOB procedure card ARE refer AS PART OF WORK PACKAGES ON OTHER item ON WHICH NO inspect IS require SUCH AS automate land check oilfilter change AND COALESCER baggage replace THE LACK OF THIS refer ON THIS ITEM IN THE WORK PACKAGE combine WITH MY LACK OF KNOWLEDGE THAT SUCH A CARD exist lead direct TO THE INADVERTENT omit OF THE inspect.THE omit WAS discover DURING CASUAL converse IN THE SHOP AREA AND local manage WAS prompt notify OF THE ERROR omit.local manage initiate ACTION TO RECTIFY THE SIT.POSSIBLE step TO PREVENT recur of the situate INCLUDE place refer TO JOB card IN ALL WORK item TO BE accomplish WHEN SUCH card EXIST AND place note alert IN WITH part WHEN ship OUT OF shop.
372~AFTER have sit THE passenger DOWN AND complete THE approach descend checklist WE enter THE terminalarea.WE begin scan THE terminalarea WITH THE RADAR FIRST BELOW start WITH THE TILT AT _ degree AND switch between NORMAL AND midranges AS WELL AS switch between precipitate AND turbulent AND decrease THE MAP DISTANCE TO AS LOW AS THE _ mile SCALE.WE THEN repeat THE SAME procedure FOR scan ABOVE go AS HIGH AS _ degree TILT UP.AFTER confirm WITH MY firstofficer THAT WE SAW NO indication OF weather OR turbulent I THEN switch TO THE TERRAIN MODE ON THE enhance groundproximitywarningsystem AND firstofficer switch hi RADAR OFF.THEN WHILE INBOUND TO WAKEM intersect ON THE WAKEM arrive TO cle airport WE WERE descend TO _ feet slow TO _ knot.JUST _ mile PRIOR TO WAKEM intersect WE WERE give A clearance TO TURN TO A _ degree head.UPON turn TO A _ degree head AND AT A speed OF _ knot WE fly THROUGH THE TOP OF A scatteredcloudlayer WHICH appear TO BE ABOUT _ feet THICK WITH NO vertical develop.AS WE fly INTO THE TOP OF THE LAYER WE encounter A JOLT OF MODERATE CHOP.THE firstofficer immediate ask THE flightattendant TO SIT DOWN OVER THE PA.I report THE NOW continue MODERATE CHOP turbulent TO airtrafficcontrol.moment LATER THE firstofficer WAS communicate WITH THE firstflight attend TO SEE IF EVERYONE WAS OK.THE firstflight attend report THAT _ flightattendant IN THE REAR appear TO BE HURT BUT THAT SHE WAS BACK IN HER jumpseat.airtrafficcontrol THEN clear US TO A _ degree head AND TO descend TO _ feet.THE moderateturbulence continue UNTIL break OUT AT _ feet.UNABLE TO SLOW AND THEN descend AT _ knot I decide THE safestcourse OF ACTION WAS TO descend WITH THE speedbrake OUT AND THRUST AT IDLE AND TRY TO SLOW IN THE descend.WE WERE AT A speed OF _ knot BY THE TIME WE BROKE OUT AT _ feet AFTER request WITH airtrafficcontrol TO REDUCE OUR speed FURTHER TO _ knot WHICH airtrafficcontrol assign.ONCE WE WERE stabilize I request AN extend DOWNWIND TO GIVE US ENOUGH TIME TO ASCERTAIN THE CONDITION ON MY CREW AND aircraft.I THEN TOLD MY firstofficer THAT SINCE WE WERE IN THE clear NOW THAT IT WAS OK FOR THE firstflight attend TO goback AND check ON THE injure crewmember.THE firstflight attend report BACK THAT THE injure flightattendant HAD sustain AN ANKLE INJURY.I ask THE firstofficer TO REQUEST WITH airtrafficcontrol TO HAVE paramedic MEET US AT THE GATE UPON OUR arrive.WE THEN inform airtrafficcontrol THAT WE WERE READY FOR approach.THE approach AND land WERE UNEVENTFUL.PRIOR TO OUR encounter THIS turbulent WE HAD NO indication THAT ani turbulent exist IN THE cle airport AREA.OUR weather BULLETIN MESSAGE contain NO PIREPS noticestoairmen OR forecast OF strongwind OR meteorologicalcondition THAT MIGHT CAUSE turbulent.NEITHER center OR THE FINAL approach control HAD ani report OF turbulent IN THE AREA PRIOR TO our.WE DID HOWEVER HELP aircraft X AND ANOTHER aircraft Y flight BEHIND US WHICH DID PREPARE EVERYONE PRIOR TO encounter THE SAME turbulent.automaticterminalinformationservice calmwind _ mile visible scatteredcloud AT _ feet temperaturedewpoint OF _ degree C.
373~WHILE ON THE KOKOMO _ arrive FROM clt airport OUT OF flightlevel clear DIRECT TO BEARZ intersect AND give _ feet.airtrafficcontrol request NO DELAY TO _ feet.LEVEL CHANGE WAS us AND speed WAS _ knot AS ALSO request BY airtrafficcontrol ZAU _.PRIOR TO level OFF AT _ feet ABOUT _ mile southsoutheast OF BEARZ intersect WE HAD A trafficadvisory follow BY AN resolutionadvisory TO descend descend.THE resolutionadvisory traffic WAS climb AND THE resolutionadvisory WAS TO descend BUT AT THE sametime airtrafficcontrol TOLD US TO STOP descend.OUR traffic WAS AN aircraft follow THEIR OWN resolutionadvisory DUE TO visualflightrulestraffic AT _ feet.captain GAVE center A PHONE CALL ON ground THE captain follow THE resolutionadvisory FOR A FEW second AND UPON reach _ feet WE WERE clear OF CONFLICT.THE resolutionadvisory seem conflict special WHEN airtrafficcontrol say STOP descend.HOWEVER resolutionadvisory WAS follow AND NEVER HAD TO GO BELOW assignedaltitude OF _ feet.
374~I WAS give operatingexperience TO A newcaptain WHO HAS BEEN ON UNION LEAVE AND HASN T fly FOR _ _ year.HE WAS fly AND I WAS ON number _ RADIO try TO GET THE downtime OF OUR early flight FOR THE record.DURING THIS TIME THE newcaptain HAD A problem WITH RADIO SWITCHOLOGY.WE BOTH got distract AND WENT TO flightlevel BEFORE I CAUGHT THE SIT.WE WENT BACK DOWN TO flightlevel.THIS WAS cause BY INEXPERIENCE NO TECHNOLOGY distract.
375~AFTER takeoff FROM grb airport THE gearhandle WAS raise BUT THE nosegear remain DOWN.AN emergency WAS declare.THE land gearhandle WAS place DOWN AND ALL _ GEAR indicate DOWN AND GREEN.AN UNEVENTFUL land WAS MADE AT grb airport AND AFTER have THE gearpin install THE aircraft WAS taxiedto THE GATE.THE problem WAS discover BY THE NOISE OF THE nosegear be DOWN.
376~I WAS work local control.I notice aircraft xa _ enter MY AIRSPACE FROM THE southwest.I call OUT TO THE aircraft WITH NO respond.I call THE _ SECTOR TO HAVE THEM SEND THE aircraft OVER.WHEN THE aircraft call IT WAS ON A CLOSE IN left BASE.I TOLD THE aircraft TO JOIN DOWNWIND.aircraft X ask ME TO turnup THE light I TOLD HIM THERE WERE OTHER aircraft ON FINAL AHEAD OF HIM JOIN THE DOWNWIND AND I WOULD CALL hi SEQUENCE.I notice THE aircraft continue TO descend AND STILL ON A BASE head.I TOLD aircraft X TO goaraound AND TO climb immediate.I PUT aircraft X ON A _ degree head AND climb HIM TO _ feet.HE miss A _ aircraft Y BY MY ESTIMATE LESS THAN _ feet VERTLY AND horizontal.I HAVE NEVER see _ aircraft IN SUCH CLOSE proximity.aircraft X return FOR land say HE HAD FIELD IN SIGHT.I clear HIM TO LAND ON runway _ AND HE land ON runway _.I allow THAT TO OCCUR JUST TO GET aircraft X safe ON THE ground.airport traffic control tower manage talk TO THE pilot OF aircraft X.manage DID NOT LOG THE INCIDENT DID NOT CALL THE region communicate center DID NOT FILL OUT PAPERWORK concern NEAR MIDAIR pilotdeviation OR ani INCIDENT report form.THE supervise TOLD ME THAT HE TOLD aircraft X THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO WAIT TO SEE IF aircraft Y call TO SEE IF ani FURTHER ACTION WOULD BE take.
377~AFTER A VISUAL approach TO runway _ land AND plan TURNOFF ON taxiway right.tower instruct US TO turnontaxiway right BUT NOT ON taxiway G.turn ON WHAT I THOUGHT WAS taxiway right THE taxiwaysign seem TO INDICATE THAT.DID NOT SEE A SIGN FOR taxiway G BUT IT turn OUT TO BE taxiway G.tower WAS NOT HAPPY ABOUT THIS AND ask US TO HOLD SO SHE COULD GET author TO us IT.THEN SHE clear US TO THE RAMP.I BELIEVE THIS COULD HAVE BEEN avoid IF THE SIGN FOR taxiway G HAD BEEN BETTER place NEVER DID SEE IT.taxiway right SIGN IS RIGHT NEXT TO taxiway G.ALSO THIS IS A BRAND NEW taxiway I SHOULD HAVE review THE airportdiagram A LITTLE close.
378~aircraft XYZ arrive AT ZZZ FROM WWW ON flight XXX ON september _ WITH AN INBOUND pilotreport OF number _ engineexhaustgastemperature OF _ degree C FOR _ SECOND ON takeoff FROM WWW.AS PER JET RUNUP HANDBOOK exhaustgastemperature FELL IN SECTION A.WE perform THE VISUAL inspect OF THE cowl BLOWOUT door INLET AND EXHAUST.NO VISUAL DAMAGE FOUND.ALSO perform A builtintestequipment ON THE number _ engineexhaustgastemperature indicate WITH NO error AND RESET indicate.SINCE NO CAUSE OF overtemperature COULD BE FOUND I notify ABC TO MONITOR engine trend FOR AND THAT A variablestatorvanes STATIC RIG check IS require TO BE DONE WITHIN _ flight cycle.AFTER aircraft depart FURTHER investigate reveal THAT aircraft HAD PREVIOUS report FOR sameproblem WITH NO maintenanceaction take WITHIN THE _ flight CYCLE LIMIT.ALSO A CONFLICT exist between OUR JET RUNUP HANDBOOK AND THE maintain MANUAL FIGURE WHICH require ALL THE ABOVE check PLUS THE FIRST AND SECOND highpressureturbine TO BE borescope AS WELL WITHIN THIS _ CYCLE LIMIT.ABC HAS BEEN notify OF THE ABOVE CONDITION TO HAVE aircraft DISCREPANCY resolve AND HAVE SENT A public revise REQUEST TO MODIFY OUR JET RUNUP HANDBOOK TO CONFORM TO THE maintain MANUAL.

405~I WAS request BY on OF MY student TO FLY WITH HIM IN THE PLANE HE WAS interest IN buy.EVEN THOUGH I HAD A BUSY SCHEDULE I SOMEHOW MADE TIME FOR AN hour IN THE AFTERNOON TO FLY.AFTER A thoroughpreflight inspect BY MY STUDENT AND MYSELF I sit DOWN IN THE aircraft AND DID A THOROUGH familiar OF THE aircraft BY go THROUGH THE aircraft MANUAL special THE emergency procedure.WE depart DAVID WAYNE hook airport toward THE north AND I demonstrate slowflight stall AND steepturn AFTER WHICH HE DID THE SAME.WE decide TO TAKE THE aircraft TO CONROE TO MAKE SURE THE horizontalsituationindicator IS work proper AND TO SEE HOW THE aircraft behave ON land.DURING THE instrumentlandingsystem approach UPON perform GUMPS check WE realize THAT WE HAD ONLY _ greenlight.AFTER perform ALL THE require check WE decide TO ASK THE OTHER traffic ON THE ground IF THEY COULD SEE OUR left maingear.THE REPLY WAS A NEGATIVE UPON WHICH I decide TO climb backup TO safe altitude TO PERFORM THE procedure FOR MANUAL land gearextension.AFTER perform THE require emergency procedure AS PER THE aircraft operatinghandbook WE decide TO PROCEED toward hook airport AND request A LOW approach AND ask THE tower TO SEE IF OUR left maingear WAS DOWN.AS suspect THE REPLY WAS A NEGATIVE.tower ask US OF OUR intent AND I advise THEM THAT I WAS go TO climb backup AND REPEAT ALL THE require procedure FOR emergency land gearextension.WE HAD NO LUCK.AGAIN WE WERE ask BY THE tower OF OUR intent AND I decide TO DO A touch and go ON THE right MAIN hope THE left MAIN WOULD dropout AS WE touch DOWN I HAD NO LUCK.BY THIS TIME I HAD decide THAT I WAS go TO LAND WITH THE GEAR IN upposition AFTER burn AS MUCH FUEL AS POSSIBLE.WE advise THEM THAT WE WERE go TO TAKE A TRIP IN THE VICINITY OF THE airport TO BURN THE FUEL AND PRACTICE THE procedure AND PREPARE FOR OUR land.THE tower advise US TO STAY WITHIN _ nauticalmile OF THE airport AND WE DID.WE WERE ask TO ADVISE THE tower _ minute BEFORE THE arrive.I request FOR A PRACTICE LOW approach SO THAT WE COULD PRACTICE THE emergency procedure FOR A gearup land.MY STUDENT WAS assign TO shutoff fuelvalve turnoff THE IGNITION AND THE MASTER WHILE I concentrate ON THE land AND OF COURSE I TOOK CARE OF THE mixture.I slow THE aircraft TO THE speed WHICH I know THIS aircraft COULD HANDLE smooth WITH FULL flap AND flare OVER THE runway TO ALLOW THE aircraft TO touchdown AS smooth AS POSSIBLE WITH THE LEAST AMOUNT OF DAMAGE TO THE aircraft.THE conclude IS THAT WE MADE IT safe AND THERE WAS ONLY minordamage TO THE aircraft.THE own OF THE aircraft WAS VERY HAPPY.THE federalaviationadministrationinspector call IT A systemfailure AND commend ME FOR handle THE emergency IN A profession AND safemanner.
406~THE localtraining flight origin FOR eug airport.THE PLAN WAS TO DO MULTIPLE PRACTICE approach AT CVO WITH A hold PRACTICE.THE FIRST approach INTO CVO WENT WELL AND WAS follow BY THE publish miss WITH A HOLD AT SHEDD intersect.AFTER hold FOR A WHILE WE request A SECOND approach TO CVO.OUR REQUEST WAS grant.I fly ANOTHER approach AND ONCE AGAIN WE decide TO DO THE publish MISS.ON THE miss approach WE advise airtrafficcontrol THAT WE want TO HOLD AT SHEDD AGAIN.HE GAVE US clearance TO HOLD AT SHEDD.I TOLD THE control THAT I WAS establish IN THE HOLD.I THEN demonstrate HOW TO CORRECT FOR THE crosswind AND ADJUST MY OUTBOUND TIME IN ORDER TO MAKE OUR inboundleg _ minute IN LENGTH.sometime LATER WHILE make ANOTHER TURN FOR THE inboundleg WE hear airtrafficcontrol advise ANOTHER pilot OF AN aircraft AT _ feet.AS WE round THE CORNER turn INBOUND THE control call THE traffic OUT TO US AS _ o'clock posit LESS THAN _ mile AT _ feet.I immediate remove MY HOOD VIEW limit DEVICE IN ORDER TO HELP SPOT THE traffic.WHEN WE SAW THE traffic IT WAS ON A converge COURSE come FROM OUR _ o'clock posit.I WOULD ESTIMATE it proximity AS _ feet horizontal AND _ feet verticalseparation.I SAW HIM MAKE A STEEP TURN TO THE left.HE WAS ON THE protect SIDE OF THE HOLD maneuver INSIDE OF OUR holdingpattern.NOW WE WERE wing LEVEL ON THE inboundleg OF THE holdingpattern AND WE immediate request AN altern clearance WHICH WAS A REQUEST FOR THE GPS approach TO runway _ AT eug airport.THE control respond WITH A QUESTION HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO THAT.I reply WE LL getback TO YOU ON THAT.WE look AT THE approach PLATE AND SAW THAT FRITT WAS THE initialapproachfix AND WE decide TO REQUEST THE approach bywayof DIRECT TO FRITT.unfortunate THE control GOT extreme BUSY ON THE RADIO.ABOUT THIS TIME WE reach SHEDD AND HAD NO choose BUT TO CONTINUE STRAIGHT OUT.THE HOLD call FOR ANOTHER right TURN WHICH WOULD HAVE place US IN close TO THE maneuver aircraft AND CREATE A collisionhazard.DUE TO THE UNFORESEEN combine OF circumstance AND THE result SIT THAT call FOR immediateaction WE need TO DEVIATE FROM OUR clearancelimit AND DEPART THE HOLD.DUE TO THE emergency NATURE of the situate I WAS TOLD THAT WE COULD NOT safe TURN right WHICH WOULD PLACE US close TO THE maneuver aircraft AND jeopard THE safe OF THE flight.WHEN THE control GOT A BREAK IN communicate HE state I SEE YOU HAVE depart THE HOLD WHAT ARE YOUR intent.I CAME BACK proceed DIRECT TO FRITT.THIS flight PATH keep US AWAY FROM THE maneuver aircraft AND resolve THE NATURE OF THE emergency.THE control GAVE US OUR newclearance TO eug airport bywayof FRITT AND GPS runway _ approach.THE approach WENT WELL AND THE flight conclude WITH A SAFE land AT eug airport.IN RETROSPECT THE depart FROM THE HOLD SHOULD HAVE BEEN precede BY addition RADIO communicate TO ALLOW THE control TO BE MORE AWARE OF OUR NEED FOR immediateaction regard OUR flightsafety.prevent action _ MORE detail RADIO communicate._ MORE force RADIO communicate._ report TO airtrafficcontrol OF visualflightrulescondition._ train IN LESS congest time.supplementalinformation FROM airborneclassificationnumber _ factor affect THE event IF airtrafficcontrol HAD advise OF THE traffic early BETTER separate WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WHICH WOULD HAVE potential allow US TO REMAIN IN THE HOLD safe.WHILE WE want TO REQUEST AN IMMEDIATE depart FROM THE HOLD DUE TO THE conflict posit OF THE visualflightrulestraffic BUSY radiotransmission provide LITTLE open FOR OUR communicate.IN conclude I THINK THAT MY action describe ABOVE ARE consist WITH THE SPIRIT AND LETTER OF federalaviationregulation section _ AND _.
407~ON september _ MY STUDENT AND I WERE come BACK FROM AN mei airport DUAL flight.MY instrument rate STUDENT express THAT HE want TO FLY THE instrumentlandingsystemrunway INTO dab airport.I radio DAYTONA approach AND receive OUR instrumentflightrulesclearance.clear dab airport bywayof radarvector altitude _ feet.HE continue fly AND TOOK OVER THE radio.I SET MY NOTEPAD WHICH I us TO COPY head AND altitude ON THE FLOOR AND pay specialattention TO hi approach procedure FOR THE SENECA.approach clear US FROM _ feet TO _ feet AND request OUR altitude.MY STUDENT respond THAT WE WERE AT _ feet BUT DIDN T READ THE altitude WE WERE clear TO.I disagree WITH hi us OF THE radio AT THAT TIME BUT say NOTHING BECAUSE WE WERE IN visualflightrulescondition.I continue look OUT FOR traffic AND glance AT THE ALTIMETER.IT READ _ feet.I TOLD HIM WE WERE clear TO _ feet AND WE SHOULD climb backup TO THAT assignedaltitude.HE insist WE WERE clear TO _ feet.I physic HELD THE yokeback TO HOLD _ feet.WHEN approach CAME BACK AND ask OUR altitude MY STUDENT say _ feet.SHE NEVER correct HIM SO I second guess MY early recollect OF OUR _ feet altitude restrict.THE control TOLD US THERE WAS OTHER traffic IN THE AREA WHICH I TOLD MY STUDENT I HAD IN SIGHT AND HE pass THAT ON TO approach.IT fly WELL clear OF OUR PLANE.THE control THEN clear US FOR THE approach.I DIDN T HEAR THE clearance BUT MY STUDENT READ IT BACK AND claim TO HAVE understand.MY STUDENT fly THE approach land AND WAS instruct TO CALL tower assoonaspossible.I call.THEY WERE UNHAPPY AND I complete understand.THE aircraft WAS AT _ feet AND WE WERE AT _ feet.BOTH OF US WERE ON AN instrumentflightrulesclearance AND BECAUSE OF OUR altitudedeviation approach WAS NOT ABLE TO KEEP THE mandate _ feet vertical clearance.I JUST WISH THEY HAD A record OF WHAT WENT ON IN THE COCKPIT.IT WAS MY LAST flight OF A VERY longday.MY STUDENT WAS A certificatedflightinstructor WITH _ hour AND HE WAS MY BEST STUDENT.hi CONFIDENT DEMEANOR MADE ME second guess WHAT I real hear.THE altitudedeviation TAUGHT ME THE TRUE liable OF A flightinstructor AND HAS lead ME AWAY FROM THE profess.I AM seek OTHER avenue OF hour build WHERE ANOTHER PERSON south MISTAKE cannot threat MY pilotcertificate.I FEAR FOR MY coworker AND THE hour require TO PAY THE bill.IT IS VERY COMMON FOR THE certificatedflightinstructor south IN THIS AREA TO PUT IN _ hour day JUST TO EARN _ hour OF REVENUE.THIS result IN HIGH FATIGUE ON THE LAST flight OF THE DAY.I M NOT THE FIRST TO EXPRESS THIS CONCERN AND I WON T BE THE LAST.I AM JUST GLAD TO BE move ON TO A safe AVIATION relate FIELD.
408~AT _ ON september _ I WAS clear BY groundcontrol TO taxiout OF THE RAMP AT stl airport.THE clearance WAS TO TAXI TO runway HOLD SHORT runway AT taxiway right.I exit THE RAMP AND cross runway _ AND THEN runway AT taxiway north.ONCE _ WAY ACROSS runway THE groundcontrol question WHAT I WAS do.THOUGH HE DID NOT specific SAY I WAS NOT clear TO CROSS THE runway hi TONE indicate SO.THERE WAS NO CONFLICT WITH ANOTHER aircraft.THE control THEN clear ME TO TAXI TO runway fulllength WHICH I DID WITHOUT INCIDENT.SINCE A taxiway DOESN T LEAD TO runway AT taxiway right ON THE northeast SIDE OF THE runway I believe I WAS clear TO crossrunway _ AND runway AND TO TAXI TO runway AT taxiway right bywayof taxiway P.IF THE control intend ME TO backtaxi ON runway _ I BELIEVE MORE SPECIFIC taxiinstruction WOULD HAVE BEEN PRUDENT.IN sever thousand OF hour OF flighttime I HAVE NEVER backtaxi DOWN A runway TO REACH ANOTHER runway WITHOUT specificinstruction TO DO SO.

552~I contact groundcontrol AT SAN ANTONIO AND request TO TAXI TO runway _ FROM us taxiway east.groundcontrol reply TAXI runway _ bywayof taxiway east OR word TO THAT EFFECT.I respond TAXI TO runway _ ON taxiway east.AS I look TO MY left WHILE taxi ON taxiway east I observe A LARGE aircraft roll OUT ON runway.I THOUGHT IT MUST BE SOMETHING THEN I look TO MY left AND SAW A LARGE aircraft hold SHORT OF runway _.I continue FORWARD believe I WAS clear TO TAXI ACROSS runway _ TO THE runuparea.BY THE TIME I reach THE runway I THOUGHT feel SOMETHING WAS WRONG.I THOUGHT I DIDN T ASK ground IF I WAS clear TO crossrunway _.THIS IS WHEN groundcontrol radio AND TOLD ME I WASN T clear TO TAXI ACROSS runway _ BUT TO TAXI ACROSS runway _ NOW TO taxiway north THEN left TO runway _.THIS IS WHEN I realize I HAD JUST violate I BELIEVE FAR _ ALBEIT unintentional.TO CORRECT MY MISTAKE FROM happen AGAIN I HAVE reread federalaviationregulation _ AND AIM _ 18.I WILL ALSO MAKE SURE I ASK airtrafficcontrol TO VERIFY THEIR instruct BEFORE enter ani runway AREA.IT IS MY GOAL AND intent TO COMPLY WITH ALL federalaviationregulation AND airtrafficcontrolinstruction FOR safetyreason.I EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO REVIEW THE federalaviationregulation airman inform manual TO BE SURE TO STAY IN comply.
553~LEVEL AT _ feet WE WERE track THE locate runway sjc airport.approximate _ mile southeast OF THE airport.traffic WAS point OUT TO US AT _ o'clock posit AS WE WERE clear TO CROSS KLIDE AT _ feet.traffic WAS spot ON trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _ _ feet BELOW US AT _ o'clock posit.BECAUSE THE traffic WAS A CONCERN THE descend TO CROSS KLIDE WAS AT _ FPM UNTIL WE WERE clear OF THE traffic.WE NEVER SAW THE traffic NOR DID WE RECEIVE A trafficadvisory ON THE trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _.HOWEVER base ON trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _ inform THE cross AT KLIDE WAS AT _ feet.THE control say NOTHING AND ONLY AFTER return TO MY HOME DID I CONSIDER THIS AN ISSUE.I SHOULD HAVE inform THE control THAT WE WERE go TO BE high AT KLIDE BECAUSE OF THE traffic.
554~DURING TAXI FROM THE GATE TO THE maintenancebase MY PARTNER WHO WAS work THE radiocontact WITH THE tower misunderstand THE tower TO crossrunway runway and right taxiway south TO THE GATE.MY PARTNER call BACK clear TO CROSS THE runway _ taxiway south TO THE GATE.THE control DID NOT getback ON THE RADIO TO CHALLENGE MY PARTNER south callback.AS A RESULT WE cross runway and right taxiway south TO THE GATE.WE DID NOT PUT ANYONE IN DANGER BECAUSE THERE WAS NO aircraft take OFF.THE control WAS NEW AND I BELIEVE HE DID clear US TO CROSS BUT WHO know.on FACTOR MAY HAVE BEEN THE TIME IT WAS AROUND _.THE tower MAY HAVE BEEN tire.
555~DURING THE arrive WE receive THE automaticterminalinformationservice AND discuss land option.AT THE TIME OF arrive THE wind WERE report TO BE _ degree AT _ knot WITH _ mile visible.ALSO AT THE TIME OF arrive THE noticestoairmen report sever taxiwayclosure AND THAT THE airport WAS run AN emergency DRILL THAT AFTERNOON AT _.AT THIS TIME THE firstofficer AND I discuss OUR option FOR land AT hpn airport.I ask THE firstofficer FOR THE runway inform IE LENGTH AND wide.WE check THE perform CHART FOR OUR land weigh AND FOUND THAT WE meet THE PART _ land require FOR A _ feet runway.AT THIS TIME WE request IF runway _ WERE avail AND WE WERE clear FOR THE VISUAL TO runway _.THE approach land AND ROLLOUT WERE NORMAL.AFTER THE TRIP WAS complete IT WAS bring TO OUR attention THAT runway _ AT hpn airport HAS A displace THRESHOLD AND THAT THE landingdistanceavailable IS _ feet THE factor land DISTANCE require FOR OUR land weigh WAS _ feet WITH A _ feet reduce FOR THE _ knot HEADWIND require US TO HAVE _ feet avail.I HAVE review THE airportdiagram AT hpn airport AND CAN SEE HOW THE displace THRESHOLD CAN BE miss DUE TO it CLOSE proximity TO THE runwayintersection.I THINK THAT THE displace THRESHOLD mark ON THE PICTORIAL DIAGRAM SHOULD BE MORE WELL define.THE runwaylength SHOULD REPRESENT THE totaldistance AND THE DISTANCE FROM THE displace THRESHOLD THIS WOULD ALLOW pilot TO MORE easy interpret THE airportdiagram.supplementalinformation FROM airborneclassificationnumber _ firstofficer fail TO REALIZE AND DID NOT RELAY TO captain THAT runway _ AT hpn airport HAD A displace THRESHOLD AND ONLY _ feet avail.THIS WAS INADEQUATE FOR propos operate.A MORE suit runway SHOULD HAVE BEEN select.factor affect firstofficer south judge decisionmaking include preoccupy WITH NUMEROUS visualflightrulestraffic inable TO CONFIRM groundtransportation WITH fixedbaseoperator FOR passenger put passenger CONVENIENCE OVER operate OF aircraft ON approach AND land.IN THE FUTURE MORE precis interpret OF approach.
556~AFTER depart WE ingest bird IN BOTH engine.AFTER consult WITH OUR DISPATCH AND maintain control I decide A RETURN TO iah airport WAS THE bestcourse OF ACTION.I DID NOT DECLARE AN emergency.WE WERE THEN vector FOR A VISUAL approach.ON DOWNWIND WE WERE ask IF WE SAW OUR COMPANY _.WE DID AND WERE clear FOR A VISUAL approach BEHIND THE _.AFTER turn FINAL I WAS ask BY airtrafficcontrol FOR FUEL AND soul onboard.WHEN I look DOWN TO FIND THE inform WE receive A trafficadvisory trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _ advise.WE HAD traffic _ feet ABOVE descend.simultaneous WE receive AN IMMEDIATE left TURN TO _ degree BY airtrafficcontrol.WE NEVER receive A trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _ resolutionadvisory.ONCE ON THE ground I SPOKE WITH THE control AND HE say WE NEVER broach OUR _ feet separate.I BELIEVE TODAY THAT WE NEVER SAW THE CORRECT _ AND follow THE wrongaircraft TO THE runway FIRST NOT SECOND _.contribute factor TO THIS INCIDENT WERE A LONG _ daytrip WITH MANY MINOR BUT tire issue THE LAST be THE birdstrike.I DO FEEL FATIGUE play A ROLE IN THIS INCIDENT.
557~WE WERE LEVEL AT _ feetmeansealevel _ knot ON LANDR _ arrive TO DEN.approach clear US TO _ feetmeansealevel.firstofficer confirm _ feet AND SET IT IN MCP altitude.I pilotnotflying confirm READBACK AND set.WHILE descend THROUGH approximate _ feet approach ask TO WHAT altitude WE WERE descend.firstofficer state _ feet.HE instruct TO LEVEL AT _ feet THAT WE HAD BEEN clear TO _ feet.WE DID SO continue TO A NORMAL approach AND land.THERE WAS NO trafficconflict.subsequentdiscussion _ between pilot BOTH RECALL _ feet AND confirm IT ON READBACK._ between airtrafficcontrol AND ME I WAS TOLD AGAIN BY TELEPHONE clear TO _ feet say HE confirm IT ON THE TAPE.speculate airtrafficcontrol AT TIME OF altitude CHANGE airtrafficcontrol TOLD US TO EXPECT runway _.HE believe WE confuse IT WITH _ feet altitude.speculate pilot AT THE TIME WE WERE IN AND OUT OF cloud AND moderateturbulence.BUT WE WERE BOTH convince WE HAD hear correct.IF OUR ERROR NEITHER OF US HAD EVER DONE SUCH A THING BEFORE.between US WE question WHETHER WE HAD actual receive descend TO _ feet THAT IT WAS AN airtrafficcontrol ERROR.recommend THE ONLY recommend THOUGH PERHAPS NOT PRACTICAL IS TO SEGREGATE altitude instruct FROM ALL OTHER airtrafficcontrol communicate.
558~ON THE earlymorning hour OF september _ approximate _ WE captain AND I land IN snow weather AT diameter.WE WERE ON THE ground FOR approximate _ hour DURING WHICH TIME IT snow ON AND OFF.ON THE preflightwalkaround WE assess THE SNOW ON THE wing AND conclude IT WOULD blowoff UPON engine STARTUP.AT THE begin OF OUR takeoff ROLL THE wing check clear OF SNOW AND ICE.THE captain WAS fly.UPON reach AN intermediatealtitude OF _ feet HE HAD FULL elevate TRIM FORWARD AND continue TO HAVE forwardpressure ON THE YOKE.AT THIS POINT THE captain ask ME TO GET cys airport approach plate AND TO PLAN TO DIVERT THERE.cys airport approach ask IF WE WOULD LIKE priorityhandling TO WHICH WE reply YES.WE ask FOR THE instrumentlandingsystemfrequency AND inboundcourse FOR THE SAKE OF EASINESS AND get inform IN A QUICK expedite WAY.WE complete THE approach.WE write THE PLANE UP.THE PLANE check OK AFTER A mechanic check IT OUT.WE deice full AND proceed TO BILLINGS WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT.
559~I D LIKE TO SAY SOMETHING ON THE affect OF FATIGUE badweather AND fly THEY DON T MIX.THIS pastmonth I work _ day _ REGULAR _ FOR train.OF THOSE _ day _ WAS EXTRA BECAUSE THE simulate BROKE.ALL IN ALL IT WAS A stress MONTH.THE DAY THIS EVENT TOOK PLACE WAS DAY _ OF _.I HAD got UP AT _ AFTER get ONLY _ _ hour OF SLEEP SO I COULD DRIVE TO WORK FOR A _ showtime.STRONG surfacewind precipitate lowceiling AND visible WERE PRESENT.THE LEG _ WAS THE worse LEG I HAVE EVER fly IN MY CAREER MY OWN emphasize.EVERYTHING WAS ROUTINE UNTIL THE approach.STRONG surfacewind weather _ overcast _ mile RAIN AND MIST WIND _ degree AT _ knot.WE WERE configure EARLY.approach GAVE US OUR INTERCEPT _ degree head TO JOIN MAINTAIN _ feet UNTIL establish clear instrumentlandingsystemrunway _.IT BECAME OBVIOUS TO ME THAT WE WERE NOT go TO JOIN ON THIS head UNTIL AFTER pass THE outermarker DUE TO THE wind SO I fly _ degree head.approach ALSO realize THIS AND GAVE US low SO WE WOULD NOT BE HIGH WHEN WE intercept THE locate.I HAD couple THE aircraft TO THE autopilot FOR A SMOOTH transit.IT NEVER happen.I disconnect THE autopilot AND decide ALONG WITH MY firstofficer TO GO miss approach.WHAT happen NEXT scare THE HELL OUT OF ME AND AS MY firstofficer admit LATER HIM TOO.I WAS SO FAR BEHIND THE aircraft AS TO SAY I HAD LOST MY situationalawareness.I FOUND MYSELF IN A _ degree BANK TO THE right descend WITH _ feet OF altitude between ME AND THE ground.I overcorrect THE descend AND climb TO _ feet OUR miss approach clearance WAS _ degree head MAINTAIN _ feet.AT on TIME IN THE _ degree BANK I WAS ON A _ degree head.I COULDN T KEEP UP WITH THE aircraft.MY firstofficer final say DO YOU WANT ME TO TAKE IT I CAN FLY IT.AT FIRST I say NO BUT realize MY action WAS FUTILE agree.HE fly THE approach AND land uneventful.WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE POSSIBLE OUTCOME OF ME try TO SALVAGE THE REST OF THIS LEG I SHUDDER.I WAS SO rattle THAT I DIDN T SLEEP MUCH THAT NIGHT.SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAS NEVER happen TO ME BEFORE NOT IN _ year OF fly.I THINK THE combine OF FATIGUE AND badweather A LATE CLOSE TURN TO INTERCEPT THE locate A SLOW autopilot A goaraound FROM AN unusualattitude AND ME NOT be IN THE LOOP ALL contribute TO THIS EVENT.THEY SAY A GOOD firstofficer IS LIKE GOLD.THANK heaven FOR MINE ON THIS DAY.crewresourcemanagement ALSO play A posit ROLL IN THAT MY firstofficer press ME diplomat ENOUGH FOR ME TO SAY ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.THAT south WHY THERE ARE _ pilot IN THE COCKPIT.supplementalinformation FROM airborneclassificationnumber _ copilot report.ON miss approach captain GOT BEHIND aircraft AND climb _ feet ABOVE assignedaltitude.
560~WE HAD A hydraulicsystem GAUGE FAIL AS WELL AS THE left transfer PUMP circuitbreaker POP.ALSO THE aircraft HAD A vibrate AT THE forwardentrydoor low PANEL ALL AT THE sametime.THE autopilot left OR number _ WAS engage.WE HAD advise center regard THE problem THAT WE encounter.WITHOUT warn THE aircraft start climb autopilot STILL engage.WE disconnect THE autopilot AT flightlevel approximate _ feet ABOVE assignedaltitude.I WAS BUSY look FOR THE circuitbreaker TO RESET DURING THE ABNORMAL condition.I COULD NOT THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE WE COULD HAVE DONE OTHER THAN handfly THE AIRPLANE.WE land WITHOUT INCIDENT.WE ALSO HAD TO REDUCE OUR speed OF _ knot TO _ knot.THE vibrate quiet DOWN AT THE slow speed.
561~MY copilot AND I taxi OUT OF THE fixedbaseoperator WITH A FALCON _.UPON reach THE END OF THE taxiway OF runway WE WERE clear FOR AN immediatetakeoff ON runway.MY copilot WHO WAS occupy THE leftseat proceed WITH A normaltakeoff.UPON reach approximate _ knot WITH NORMAL callout MY copilot release control OF THE TILLER.THE aircraft immediate MADE A SHARP TURN TO THE left.HE immediate try TO REGAIN control WITH THE TILLER WITH LITTLE SUCCESS.us THE RUDDER AND right brake WE regain control OF THE aircraft AND proceed WITH A normaltakeoff NOT AWARE OF ani DAMAGE TO THE aircraft OR groundequipment.enroute TO mke airport ZID ask US IF WE HAD MADE CONTACT WITH ani groundequipment WE say NO.THE airtrafficcontrol ask US IF WE HAD sustain ani DAMAGE TO THE aircraft WE say NO.base ON THE SIT IN sdf airport WE decide TO DIVERT TO YIP.UPON arrive TO YIP WE notify maintain.base UPON WHAT HAS happen I WILL RETHINK ABOUT put COPLTS IN THE leftseat.supplementalinformation FROM airborneclassificationnumber _ THE pilotincommand write UP THE TILLER ON THE DISCREPANCY LOG.
562~ON descend TO THE BREMEN airport THE automaticterminalinformationservice WAS receive AND altimeter SET TO _ inch.THE aircraft enter visualmeteorologicalconditions pass THROUGH _ feetmeansealevel _ abovegroundlevel WITH THE airport IN SIGHT.AS WE level OFF AT _ feetmeansealevel THE control state WE WERE approximate _ feet LOW ON altitude.WITH THE airport IN SIGHT THE airport WAS call IN SIGHT AND A VISUAL approach WAS request.AFTER land TAXI IN AND SHUTDOWN WE discover THE altimeter WERE SET AT _ inch AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN SET AT _ ML.contribute factor _ onduty _ hour FATIGUE._ hour flight WITH _ STOP FOR FUEL AND ALL NIGHT TRANSATLANTIC flight.
563~ON depart WE WERE give climb TO _ feet.AFTER _ minute control issue climb TO _ feet WITH _ feet restrict AT pilotsoperatingmanual.WE comply WITH THIS.JUST OVER pilotsoperatingmanualveryhighfrequencyomnidirectionalradiorange WE receive AN resolutionadvisory TO climb AND WE notice A TARGET ON THE trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _ _ feet ABOVE US AT ABOUT _ mile.I immediate respond TO THE resolutionadvisory AND begin AN ABRUPT climb TO _ feet.WE fly ABOVE THE OTHER aircraft _ feet AS I REMEMBER.WE NEVER SAW THE OTHER aircraft.THE control say THAT HE HAD try TO CONTACT US WE BELIEVE THAT HE WAS call US AT THE sametime WE WERE get OUR FIRST trafficadvisory.I hear HIM CALL AGAIN BUT I WAS NOW respond TO THE resolutionadvisory.I DON T KNOW WHY THE control allow EITHER US OR THEM TO BE IN THAT SIT.ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS OUR SIDE OF WHAT happen.
564~I WAS captain AND pilotflying ON A schedule aircraft flight FROM CLEVELAND OH TO BALTIMORE MD.approach vector US TO AN instrumentlandingsystem VISUAL TO runway _.approach THEN inform US THAT runway _ WAS go TO BE close AND THEN vector US TO instrumentlandingsystemrunway AND inform US THAT A BARON WOULD BE paralleltraffic TO runway.I ALSO hear OTHER traffic be vector TO runway _.AS I WAS touch DOWN AND roll OUT tower inform US TO MAKE OUR TURNOFF AT taxiway east THE LAST TURNOFF PRIOR TO runway _ intersect OR TO EXPEDITE THROUGH runway _ BUT NOT TO turnoff ONTO runway _.THEN IT occur TO ME THIS WAS A landandholdshortoperations AND I HAD SERIOUS REASON TO BELIEVE THAT WE MIGHT HIT THE OTHER aircraft A generalaviation TYPE.I apply heavy brake WHICH disengage THE automaticbrake THAT I HAD select TO number _ OUT OF _ _ OR maximum.I MADE THE TURNOFF AT taxiway east.I taxi IN AND AFTER park AT THE GATE I ask groundcontrol FOR THE telephonenumber TO THE tower AND I call FROM THE JETWAY.I DID NOT SPEAK TO THE ACTUAL control.I TOLD THE tower PERSON WHAT HAD transpire AND I DIDN T LIKE IT.main BECAUSE _ THIS WAS A landandholdshortoperations AND I WASN T TOLD._ WAS fly A _ WHICH WAS JUST get landandholdshortoperations approve._ I DID NOT HAVE THE miss approach instruct FOR THE runway WITH landandholdshortoperations FOR runway _._ I DID NOT KNOW IF I HAD THE COMPANY require MINIMUM DISTANCE FOR landandholdshortoperations _ feet._ IF I HAD BEEN TOLD THAT THIS WAS A landandholdshortoperations I WOULD HAVE deny IT.IN MY OPINION landandholdshortoperations IS us FOR increase operate ONLY AND IS A LOSE LOSE SIT FOR THE pilot.I CONSIDER THIS A seriouserror AND I HAVE NO RECOURSE.ALSO _ THE _ IS heavy THAN THE _ EVEN THOUGH seat CAPACITY IS THE SAME AND ROLLOUTS ARE long.
565~AS WE WERE signal INTO THE GATE JUST inch FROM park THE left WINGTIP contact A fueltruck.PAINT WAS scrape FROM THE TRUCK AND DAMAGE WAS DONE TO THE navigate lightassembly.A SIGNALMAN DID NOT SEE THE wingwalker south ATTEMPT TO GET THE aircraft stop BEFORE collide WITH THE fueltruck.INADEQUATE RAMP mark TIGHT space AND congest AROUND THE aircraft contribute TO THE MISHAP.
566~AFTER cruise FOR _ minute AT _ feetmeansealevel I change tank FROM left TO right.I turn ON THE MASTER fuelpump.THE engine seem VAPOR lock starve OF FUEL.I try pump THE PRIMER AND shut THE MASTER ON AND OFF.I COULD NOT GET FUEL TO THE engine.BY THIS TIME I glide TO _ feet AT WHICH POINT I declare AN emergency AND look FOR A FIELD IN ORDER TO LAND.I land IN A cornfield.WHEN I check THE tank ON THE ground I FOUND THE right TANK FULL.
567~pilot WAS TOLD TO MAKE _ degree turnonrunway BY tower TO taxiback TO park.pilot execute _ degree turnonrunway _ AFTER SMOOTH land.pilot WAS NOT SURE WHETHER THE PLANE WOULD TURN SHARP ENOUGH TO AVOID go OVER THE EDGE OF THE ASPHALT runway ONTO THE GRASS TO COMPLETE TURN.pilot finish _ degree TURN BY taxi ONTO GRASS AND BACK ONTO runway.propel STRUCK runway AS WE LEFT GRASS SURFACE.THE runway HAD A sever dropoff ONTO THE GRASS AT THAT POINT.pilot taxi BACK TO park.
568~BOTH NEW YORK approachcontrol AND hpn airport tower report THAT AN aircraft WAS IN THE AREA AT _ feetmeansealevel AND THAT THEY WERE NOT IN CONTACT WITH airtrafficcontrol.WE locate THIS aircraft AS WE approach THE outermarker.WE HAD TO TURN TO THE left AND leveloff TO AVOID THIS aircraft.
569~approximate _ minute AFTER takeoff A passenger CALL BUTTON WENT OFF.THIS IS NOT UNUSUAL AND SINCE WE WERE STILL climb NONE OF THE flightattendant respond TO IT.I HAD VISUAL ACCESS TO THE CABIN SO I look AT WHERE THE LIGHT WAS AND SAW NO ACTIVITY.IT WENT OFF AGAIN SO THE OTHER flightattendant AND I WENT UP TO THE ROW AND SAW A MAN SEIZING.WE immediate page FOR A PHYSICIAN AND _ respond.THE MAN continue TO CONVULSE AND THE PEOPLE travel WITH HIM state HE WAS EPILEPTIC.WE relay THIS inform immediate TO THE captain ALONG WITH THE TYPE OF medic THE MAN WAS take.THE captain MADE THE DECISION TO DIVERT TO phl airport.UPON land paramedic CAME ABOARD AND TOOK THE passenger AWAY.NO FURTHER INCIDENT occur.I FEEL LIKE DESPITE THE HECTIC moment THIS INCIDENT WENT smooth BECAUSE OF CREW communicate.EVERYONE remain CALM AND EFFICIENT.
570~enginenumber _ flame OUT AT IDLE THRUST DURING approach TO hkg airport AT _ feetmeansealevel AT _ knot.lightrain NO turbulent.restart OK._ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report indicate IN THE CALLBACK THE maintenancedepartment FOUND THAT WITHIN THE FUEL control THE HYDRAULICALLY operate VALVE THAT allow OR send A SIGNAL TO THE STATOR vane TO MODULATE HAD fail.THE apply OF power AT THE TIME OF THE FLAMEOUT WAS follow AN extend IDLE descend.RESTART WAS accomplish AND engine operate normal THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE approach AND land include revers AND TAXI.
571~WE WERE descend FROM flightlevel TO flightlevel WHEN number _ engine roll BACK TO flight IDLE.WE WERE IN THE cloud WITH engine AND WING TAIL antiice ON.THERE WERE NO indication OF ice.BOTH throttle WERE align.number _ engine THROTTLE WENT TO maximum climb power AND number _ engineindication WERE idlepower WHILE WE continue THE descend toward _ feet.THE STANDBY engine indicate verify THE PRIMARY engineindication ON THE multifunctiondisplayunit THAT number _ engine WAS NEAR IDLE.vibrate indicate WAS NORMAL.number _ engine WOULD NOT RESPOND TO movement OF number _ THROTTLE.WE HAD A SLIGHT YAW OF THE AIRPLANE correct BY RUDDER.AFTER _ minute engine CAME BACK TO fullpower AND work proper THE REST OF THE flight INTO ORD.AFTER land WE write UP THE number _ engine.ORD maintenancepersonnel TOOK THE AIRPLANE OTS AND say THAT THIS AIRPLANE HAD NOT HAD THE fuelcontrolunit modify FOR THE _ AND THAT THIS TYPE OF engine ROLLBACK COULD HAPPEN.I BELIEVE THAT modify AND problem LIKE THIS SHOULD BE communicate TO THE FLCS SO THAT WE CAN ANTICIPATE THESE type OF event AND RESPOND proper.LACK OF PROPER inform TO THE flightcrew THAT THE COMPANY know ABOUT COULD HAVE BEEN VERY us DURING THIS EVENT.
572~ON FINAL approach TO runway AT mco airport THE auxiliarypowerunit firewarninglight illuminate AND THE firebell sound.THE firehandle WAS pull AND rotate TO DISCHARGE THE firebottle.THE LIGHT remain illuminate BUT THERE WAS NO OTHER indicate OF A FIRE.WE land clear THE runway AND taxi immediate TO THE GATE WHERE THE ONCOMING CREW WAS wait.WE RAN THE checklist DURING THE shorttaxi.THE ONCOMING firstofficer GAVE NO indicate OF ANYTHING IRREGULAR AND THE captain immediate LEFT THE aircraft TO INSPECT THE auxiliarypowerunit AREA.ALL appear NORMAL.captain call DISPATCH DUTY control AND CONTRACT maintain.WE believe THIS TO BE THE safestaction TO TAKE be IT WAS ALL lastminute IN THE flight AND runway WAS CLOSE TO THE GATE.THE auxiliarypowerunit WAS NOT run AND HAD BEEN OFF ABOUT _ hour _ minute PRIOR TO THE firewarning WITH NO attempt RESTART.WE plug groundpower IN AT THE GATE.look BACK AT THIS EVENT be IT ALL CAME TOGETHER IN THE LAST FEW minute OF THE flight WE overlook tell tower OF WHAT WAS go ON AND TO DECLARE AN emergency AND TO CALL THE firetruck.IT WAS A falseindication.nexttime SLOW DOWN get aircraft TO THE GATE TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE LITTLE thing DONE ALSO AND TO NOTIFY PEOPLE DURING THE EVENT NOT AFTER.
573~altitudedeviation.AT flightlevel ON THE _ _ arrive INTO phl airport center GAVE US A clearance TO CROSS RADDS intersect AT _ feet._ feet WAS SET INTO THE altitudealert AND WE start OUR descend OUT OF flightlevel.WE GOT INTO A discuss ABOUT checklist procedure AND AT _ feet I announce _ feet FOR _ feet.I proceed TO leveloff AT _ feet._ mile north OF RADDS intersect control question OUR clearance.I THEN descend TO _ feet AS previous clear.JUST A PLAIN OLD LACK OF concentrate ON MY PART.NO OTHER traffic IN AREA.supplementalinformation FROM airborneclassificationnumber _ AT flightlevel ON THE _ _ arrive INTO phl airport center GAVE US A clearance TO CROSS RADDS intersect AT _ feet._ feet WAS select IN THE altitude ALERT AND captain initiate OUR descend OUT OF flightlevel.WE GOT INTO A discuss ABOUT OUR checklist procedure._ mile north OF RADDS THE control query OUR clearance BECAUSE WE HAD level OFF AT _ feet.THE captain descend TO _ feet AS previous clear.IT WAS NOT THE TIME OR PLACE TO HAVE THIS discuss WHILE WE WERE descend INTO THE terminalarea.I SHOULD HAVE pay closerattention AND NOT BEEN divert FROM maintain MY situationalawareness.NO conflictingtraffic IN THE AREA.
574~INBOUND TO CTW FROM west destinate PIT airtrafficcontrol assignedheading OF _ degree FOR traffic.A FEW minute laterairtrafficcontrol assign left TURN head _ degree.WE confirm THE headingassignment AS IT seem VERY UNUSUAL.airtrafficcontrol THEN clear US TO descend TO flightlevel.pass flightlevel airtrafficcontrol ask US TO CONFIRM altitudeassignment OF flightlevel.WE reply THAT WE WERE clear TO flightlevel BUT WOULD RETURN TO flightlevel.AT THAT TIME WE notice ANOTHER aircraft AT OUR altitude AND A trafficadvisory.GLARE FROM SUN HAD previous obscure OUR VIEW AND trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _ SCREEN.I stop THE TURN AND return TO flightlevel.NO trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _ resolutionadvisory ONLY A trafficadvisory.

576~UPON arrive AT aircraft FOR A schedule flight FROM ZZZ TO okc airport MY FIRST ACT AFTER enter THE COCKPIT WAS TO REVIEW THE aircraftlogbook.THIS LOGBOOK alert ME TO _ item on OF WHICH WAS THE inoperative STATUS OF THE number _ FUEL GAUGE.ALSO IN THE LOGBOOK WAS AN ENTRY MADE BY maintain detail HOW THE TANK HAD BEEN fuel WITH A know QUANTITY OF FUEL COMPLETE WITH THE mechanic south SIGNATURE AND certificatenumber.make SURE THE captain WAS alert TO THESE fact I inform HIM OF THE writeup AND hand HIM THE LOGBOOK.I THEN perform A fuelquantity check TO DETERMINE IF THE FUEL QUANTITIES match.THE calculate indicate THAT WE WERE approximate _ gallon SHORT OF FUEL.AFTER DOUBLE AND triplecheck MY calculate I alert THE captain AS TO MY discover.HE look AT THE DATA AND perform SOME calculate OF hi OWN AND confirm THAT THERE WAS A DISCREPANCY.HE suggest check THE number ON THE FUEL SLIP TO DETERMINE IF THE FUELER HAD perform THE CORRECT calculate.THEY WERE CORRECT.AT THIS TIME HE direct ME TO GO OUTSIDE TO THE fuel PANEL ON THE UNDERSIDE OF THE WING AND TAKE A LOOK THERE.HOWEVER MY action OUTSIDE THE aircraft alert THE mechanic WHO meet ME AS I walk BACK toward THE COCKPIT.HE ask ME WHAT THE problem WAS.I inform HIM THAT WE WERE have A problem verify HOW MUCH FUEL WAS ON THE AIRPLANE.HE state THAT HE HAD fuel THAT TANK AND IT WAS top OFF.I FURTHER emphasize THE FACT THAT OUR calculate show THAT WE WERE _ gallon SHORT OF FUEL.HE restate THAT HE WAS posit THE TANK WAS FULL OF FUEL.DURING THE ensure flight I observe NO indication THAT EVER cause ME TO DOUBT THAT OUR PREVIOUS conclude concern THE _ gallon OF FUEL WERE NOT VALID.IT WAS DURING OUR refuel procedure THAT THE firstindication OF A problem arise.NO MATTER HOW WE configure THE fuelsystem WE COULD NOT SEEM TO GET MUCH FUEL OUT OF tanknumber _.AFTER NUMEROUS system check AND A DRIPSTICK OF tanknumber _ WE determine THAT THE TANK HAD BEEN VERY near EMPTY WHEN WE SHUT THE engine DOWN AT THE GATE.AT THIS POINT WE decide TO FILL THIS NOW verify EMPTY TANK FROM THE TRUCK AND DETERMINE A know QUANTITY IN IT BY check IT AGAINST THE METER ON THE TRUCK.WE expect A TOTAL OF approximate _ gallon.AT THIS TIME BOTH THE firstofficer AND MYSELF WERE observe THE fuel operate BY THE TRUCK.AT _ gallon THE VOLUMETRIC topoff system erroneous close THE fuel VALVE.THE mechanic THEN check THE DRIPSTICK AND state THAT THE TANK WAS NOT FULL.HE RESET THE system AND fuel WAS resume.I continue TO OBSERVE THE fuel operate UNTIL THE VOLUMETRIC topoff system AGAIN stop fuel.THIS TIME HOWEVER THE METER indicate _ gallon.THIS match THE know QUANTITY WE expect TO PUMP INTO THE TANK.THE totalfuel UPLIFT calculate verify THIS.WE WERE NOW satisfy THAT WE HAD THE PROPER AMOUNT OF FUEL AT THIS TIME.THE remain OF THE TRIP proceed WITHOUT INCIDENT.OUR COMPANY policy STATE THAT maintain IS RESPONSIBLE FOR verify THE fuelload IN THE TANK WITH THE inoperativefuel GAUGE.IT appear OBVIOUS THAT THEY WERE NOT THOROUGH IN THEIR duty AND WERE fool BY A fault VOLUMETRIC topoff indicate WHICH stop fuel TO THAT TANK approximate _ gallon SHORT OF FULL.properaction BY THE flightcrew COULD HAVE prevent THIS INCIDENT HOWEVER.THE fuelquantity check I HAD perform early GAVE US SOME indicate THAT THERE WAS A problem.WHENEVER A contradict SUCH AS THIS occur IT IS THE DUTY OF THE flightcrew TO NOW VERIFY IT FOR THEMSELVES.THAT WOULD HAVE prevent THIS INCIDENT.
577~I AS THE certificatedflightinstructor WAS demonstrate A WHEEL land TO A STUDENT WHO JUST purchase THE _.DURING THE land ROLL control WAS LOST AND THE aircraft LEFT THE GRASS runway STRUCK A ROUGH PIECE OF TERRAIN WENT UP ON NOSE slight AND STRUCK THE propel AND cowl.apparentdamage TO propel cowl AND WHEEL pant.THE ONLY correct OR CHANGE THAT I AM UNSURE OF IS IT feel TO ME AS IF THE left RUDDER STUCK OR MY FOOT CAUGHT SOMETHING ON THE SIDE OF THE house AND prevent MY push THE RUDDER TO THE left.THE STUDENT AND I BOTH HAD exchange inform AND I WAS fly THE demonstrate.look AT SKID mark I NOW THINK THE STUDENT WAS ON THE brake WITH ME.THE OTHER THING I notice IS AN ANGLE BRACKET THAT control THE HEATER stick OUT ABOUT _ INCH AND MAYBE MY FOOT CAUGHT THAT.
578~ON takeoff WE discover THAT THE flightmanagementcomputer HAD fail TO initial proper ALTHOUGH THE captain HAD check IN preflight ONCE AND I HAD check IT TWICE.HENCE WE WERE UNABLE TO us IT FOR navigate.WHILE I fly THE AIRPLANE ON rawdata THE captain attempt TO SORT OUT THE flightmanagementcomputer.AT _ feetmeansealevel THE altitudealert WENT OFF.WE HAD BEEN clear TO climb TO _ feet.AS WE return TO OUR assignedaltitude depart control confirm OUR assignedaltitude.obvious NEITHER OF US WERE watch THE altitude.nexttime I AM confront WITH A problem I WILL TRY TO us THE autopilot TO REDUCE MY WORKLOAD AND INCREASE MY situationalawareness.
579~runway CHANGE ON taxiout FROM runway TO runway.shorttaxi.RESET COCKPIT AND flightmanagementsystem FOR runway depart BUT DID NOT RESET BRAIN.I WAS STILL IN THE STRAIGHT OUT depart FOR runway MODE AND miss THE TURN TO _ degree ON THE runway NOISE depart.WE WENT approximate _ mile PAST turnpoint BEFORE initiate TURN TO _ degree.
580~depart ZZZ AT NIGHT AS pilotnotflying WITH number _ engine antiice minimumequipmentlist ED AT ABC WITH antiice VALVE fault.minimumequipmentlist call FOR antiice VALVE TO BE lock OPEN AS maintenanceprocedure.BOTH captain AND I query maintain ABOUT ADVISABILITY OF operate IN ZZZ DURING THE SUMMER WITH antiice ON.WE ALSO consult aircraft operate MANUAL limit AND FOUND outsideairtemperature NOT A limit FACTOR WITH roll ROYCE engine BUT DID FIND A CAUTION STATEMENT IN THE aircraft operate MANUAL ABOUT operate WITH antiice ON WITH AMBIENT temperature ABOVE _ degree C.maintenancetechnician south respond TO ME WAS PARAPHRASED IT WAS NOT OUR JOB TO BE second guess DISPATCH control AND OR maintain control ABOUT THIS.SO ON takeoff initialclimbout THIS IS WHAT I BELIEVE happen ON takeoff ROLL autothrottle ON maximum enginepressureratio select PER minimumequipmentlist engine indicate NORMAL.AT approximate _ feetabovegroundlevel captain call FOR climb power AND AS I reach FOR THE climb THRUST pushbutton BOTH captain AND I view number _ exhaustgastemperature DISPLAY CHANGE TO RED indicate exceed.captain retard number _ powerlever TO BRING exhaustgastemperature BELOW limit.natural autothrottle drive number _ THRUST LEVER TO COMPENSATE FOR LOST OVERALL THRUST AND THUS number _ engineexhaustgastemperature exceed limit AS WELL._ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ THE report state WHEN maintain WAS question ABOUT THE operate OF number _ engine WITH THE antiice VALVE inoperative OPEN THEY brush IT OFF WITH NO posit ANSWER.THE report say WITH THE HIGH AMBIENT FIELD temperature AT takeoff WOULD MAKE number _ engine OPERATE CLOSE TO limit.THE report say AFTER THE temperature exceed OF BOTH engine maintain check BOTH engine PER THE maintain MANUAL AND FOUND NO DAMAGE.

613~ON AN instrumentflightrulesflight PLAN FROM bkl airport I WAS THE pilotflying AND WAS give AN instrumentflightrulesclearance TO climb TO _ feet ON A head.THIS WAS A climb OF ABOUT _ feet FROM THE airportelevation AFTER takeoff.DURING THE climbout WE WERE give sever headingchange AFTER be hand OFF FROM THE tower TO approachcontrol AND AT THE SAME GENERAL TIME WE WERE give A trafficadvisory.WE ALSO receive sever message AT THE SAME approximate TIME.WHILE look FOR traffic OUTSIDE I WENT _ feet ABOVE MY assignedaltitude OF _ feet FOR JUST A COUPLE OF second.I realize MY MISTAKE AND instant WENT BACK TO _ feet.FOR A COUPLE OF second MY MIND COULD HAVE wander OR I COULD HAVE THOUGHT I WAS assign A higheraltitude OR I COULD HAVE BEEN look AT THE VIEW OF THE CITY.AT ani RATE I HAD A moment MENTAL LAPSE AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN concentrate MORE ON fly THE AIRPLANE AND MY altitude.THERE WERE NO traffic incursion OR AIRSPACE violate OTHER aircraft WERE VISUAL AND THE ground WAS NOT A FACTOR._ feet IS TOO LOW TO ASSIGN A jetaircraft FOR initialaltitude.
614~AFTER verify WE HAD THE airport IN SIGHT WE WERE clear FOR THE VISUAL approach TO stl airport runway.WE WERE arrive FROM THE south.apparent A _ WAS clear FOR VISUAL runway.WE WERE NOT TOLD OF POSSIBLE conflict converge traffic FROM north FOR parallelrunway.AT ABOUT TIME OF join localizertypedirectionalaid WE receive A trafficadvisory follow immediate BY AN resolutionadvisory TO descend.WE DID rapid WHICH WAS follow immediate BY LEVEL THEN climb BY WHICH TIME traffic WAS INSIGHT ABOUT _ feet TO OUR right AT WHICH TIME WE remain clear OF traffic visual.traffic WAS AT approximate samealtitude descend AS WE WERE ON approach.WE respond immediate TO resolutionadvisory south WHICH probable WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN NECESSARY HAD WE BEEN inform OF traffic AND THE possible OF A potentialconflict WITH converge traffic.
615~WE WERE give A descend FROM flightlevel TO flightlevel.WHILE descend THROUGH flightlevel control request OF ME TO EXPEDITE THROUGH flightlevel DUE TO south traffic.WHILE pass THROUGH flightlevel I notice A SHADOW PASS THROUGH MY left sidewindow.SKY WAS clear aircraft Y call LEVY frequency _ AND report A _ pass immediate UNDER hi aircraft.MADRID fail TO ADVISE OF conflictingtraffic locate AND altitude.aircraft Y fail TO CALL traffic ON trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _ AND neglect TO COMPLY WITH trafficadvisory resolutionadvisory advisory.MADRID fail TO DISCUSS THE SIT AFTER THE EVENT.MY aircraft WAS equip WITH trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _ WHEN initial purchase BUT unfortunate manage AND THE maintenancedepartment elect TO REMOVE IT DUE TO ECONOMIC reason.
616~AFTER taxi bywayof taxiway Y K AND F I taxi ONTO runway AT mdw airport.I line UP ON WHAT appear TO BE A runwaycenterline AND apply takeoffpower.AFTER travel approximate _ feet I STRUCK A taxiwaysign WITH THE right propel.AFTER abort THE takeoff I taxi BACK TO park bywayof taxiway Y.AS I taxi ONTO THE runway I watch PRIOR land traffic clear THE runway.I follow THE taxiline TO A LARGE whiteline I LATER discover IT WAS THE LINE indicate THE right OF THE runway.I begin TO APPLY takeoffpower IN stage.I HAD approximate _ inch OF manifoldpressure AND _ FPM WHEN I STRUCK THE SIGN.I SAW THE SIGN ABOUT _ _ SECOND BEFORE IMPACT.AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS A CARDBOARD BOX FROM MY posit IT AS entire block AND THE IMPACT feel NO MORE substance THAN THAT.HOWEVER I choose TO ABORT THE takeoff WHEN I hear AN ODD BUZZ AS I begin TO REAPPLY power.I ALSO discover THAT THE taxiline cross runway BUT doe NOT crossrunway runway.I FOUND THIS TO BE mislead.IT IS VERY HARD TO identify runwayalignment ON THE ground WITHOUT VERY clear PAVEMENT mark BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY runway AND taxiwaylight AS TO BE confuse.I FOUND OUT THAT I AM number _ OF _ TO DO THIS.
617~RADIO WENT OUT DUE TO BAD FUSE.land AT _ SGR WITHOUT control tower approve.WAS NOT SURE THAT IT WAS operate SINCE I COULD NOT RAISE IT ON MY handheldradio EITHER.BATTERY HAD BEEN discharge inflight keep announce OVER airport frequency THEN enter PATTERN AND land.FUSE HAD COME LOOSE IN HARNESS.RADIO operate AFTER replace fuse.NO incident AND traffic WAS LIGHT.
618~msy airport ground clear US TO TAXI TO runway _ bywayof taxiway south.AS WE approach A constructionarea ABEAM CONCOURSE GATE A _ WAS TOLD TO MOVE TO THE right AND HOLD FOR A _ THEN TAXI TO GATE.aircraft Y say IT south OK WE CAN MAKE IT._ continue TO TAXI IN violate OF it clearance.IT WAS APPARENT _ WAS NOT go TO STOP SO I HAD TO abrupt STOP aircraft SET parkingbrake AND WAIT.THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH ROOM FOR _ aircraft TO PASS IN THIS constructionarea.IN FACT WE stop _ feet SHORT OF THE narrow AREA SO AS TO NOT COLLIDE WITH aircraft Y.aircraft Y turn TOWARD US THEN THEY turn AWAY.THE _ taxi INTO A nonmovement AREA WITH hi wingover A construct FENCE.HAD WE NOT stop WE WOULD HAVE HAD AN ACCIDENT.REAL CAUSE AIRLINE Y south taxi TOO FAST.THEY violate AN airtrafficcontrolclearance.SOLUTION MONITOR aircraft Y TAXI procedure.someday WE ARE go TO HAVE A seriousproblem WHEN aircraft Y HAS A ground ACCIDENT IF NOTHING IS DONE ABOUT THEIR TAXI technique.SOLUTION TO THIS on VIOLATE aircraft Y FOR violate A clearance AND endanger _ passenger AND _ crewmember ON MY flight ALONG WITH passenger AND CREW OF aircraft Y aircraft.
619~WHILE transit FROM enroute TO approach I request THE instrumentlandingsystemdistancemeasuringequipment runway _ approach TO KETCHIKAN airport.I ALSO request THAT THE ONBOARD instrumentflightrules certify GPS BE substitute FOR THE OTS nondirectionalbeacon AT CLAM COVE WHICH WAS require TO EXECUTE THE miss approach.THIS substitute HAS BEEN approve IN OUR companyoperation specify center state THAT THEY COULD NOT APPROVE THE approach SINCE THE nondirectionalbeacon WAS OTS.I THEN request AND receive THE GPS approach TO runway _ AT KETCHIKAN AND land WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT.I DID NOT FEEL IT PRUDENT TO ARGUE WITH center OVER THE RADIO.HOWEVER I FEEL HE SHOULD HAVE ask ME IF MY equip WAS certify TO COMPLY WITH MY substitute REQUEST RATHER THAN complete DENY MY REQUEST.
620~AFTER takeoff THE left FIRE LOOP LIGHT CAME ON indicate A problem WITH THE firedetection system.THE LIGHT WENT OUT THEN THE left firewarninglight CAME ON.BOTH light THEN WENT ON AND OFF intermittent.ALL engineindication WERE NORMAL AND THERE WAS NO VISUAL sign OF A FIRE.WE advise THE tower of the situate AND MADE A precaution land AT FWA airport.WE MADE A NORMAL land AND THERE WERE NO MORE firewarning indication.A mechanic determine THAT THE FIRE LOOP WAS LOOSE AND WAS short OUT ON THE engine cause THE falsewarning.
621~enroute TO bgr airport WITH plan FUEL FOR A PART _ flight AND NO altern base ON COMPANY approve FORECAST.OVER pwm airport learn THAT companyaircraft WAS hold AT pwm airport DUE TO lowvisibility.appear clear FROM altitude.decide TO check bgr airport weather.learn THAT currentweather WAS DOWN TO LESS THAN _ mile WITH runwayvisualrange vary between _ feetrunwayvisualrange.base ON FUEL remain onboard THE CREW decide TO DIVERT TO bos airport TO AVOID ani UNNECESSARY emergencysituation.flight WAS divert TO bos airport AND refuel.THE flight WAS THEN dispatch BACK TO bgr airport WITH _ alternate base ON NEW amend FORECAST.WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE WARY OF FORECAST base ON EXPERIENCE fly IN northeast.CREW utilize goodjudgement AND avoid A potential PRECARIOUS SIT.
622~short AFTER _ flight depart atl airport BOUND FOR mcn airport.immediate AFTER takeoff VERY STRONG AND LOUD vibrate force US TO RETURN FOR IMMEDIATE land.IT WAS FOUND THAT THE cargodoor HAD BEEN LEFT OPEN.short AFTER board PRIOR TO THE flight I check THE maintenancelog AND defer LOG.WE FOUND THAT THE cargodoor indicate LIGHT HAD BEEN defer.AS WAS CUSTOMARY I advise THE firstofficer short BEFORE depart TO INSPECT THE fuelpanel door BUT ALSO TO INCLUDE THE cargodoor IN hi lastminute check.THIS WAS DONE approximate _ minute BEFORE depart.ABOUT _ minute BEFORE depart THE rampagent WHO load OUR AIRPLANE hand US THE PAPERWORK TO COMPLETE THE LOAD MANIFEST FORM.IT seem reason TO ASSUME THE PERSON load OUR AIRPLANE WOULD ALSO SERVE AS A double check TO THE STATUS OF OUR cargodoor AND THAT AFTER ALL bag HAD BEEN load AND THE QUANTITY OF bag verify THAT THE rampagent WOULD MAKE SURE THE cargodoor WAS close.THE firstofficer AGAIN verbal verify TO ME THAT THE cargodoor WAS close immediate PRIOR TO engine START.WE LATER discover THAT rampagent south origin COUNT OF THE bag WAS terrible INACCURATE.state origin THAT WE HAD _ check bag ONLY WE FOUND THAT WE true HAD _ check bag _ carryonbaggage _ pound OF CARGO AND _ pound OF COMPANY MAIL.THIS point TO _ OF _ possible.EITHER EXTRA CARGO WAS add WITHOUT THE rampagent south KNOWLEDGE OR THE ramp south IRRESPONSIBILITY AND LACK OF accurate IN count bag lead TO A lastminute BREAKDOWN IN safe.WE LATER continue THE flight TO mcn airport WITH NO FURTHER problem.
623~ON takeoff ROLL AT _ knot autopilot number _ disengage light AND HORN sound autopilot OFF.reject takeoff perform.maximum automaticbrake us AT _ knot.taxi clear OF runway AND HELD UNTIL brake cool.maintain check ALL tire AND brake.subsequenttakeoff WAS NORMAL AND NO aircraftmaintenancelog writeup.AFTER clear runway probable SHOULD HAVE MADE aircraftmaintenancelog writeup AND HAD maintain clear AIRPLANE.
624~clear FOR takeoff ON runway.ANOTHER aircraft report _ mile FINAL runway.AT approximate _ knot tower call US say takeoffclearance cancel.captain abort aircraft reject takeoff.tower ask IF WE COULD HOLD SHORT FROM runway.firstofficer reply NEGATIVE.POLICY IS captain reject ALL takeoff land aircraft ON runway initiate A goaraound.AFTER reject takeoffchecklist complete WE HAD firetruck INSPECT aircraft FOR DAMAGE AND TIRE DAMAGE.NO problem note.WE taxi BACK FOR ANOTHER takeoff.towercontroller SHOULD NOT HAVE cancel OUR takeoffclearance.SHOULD HAVE SENT THE OTHER aircraft AROUND.concern FOR aircraft AND passenger AT takeoff SHOULD HAVE PRIORITY OVER land aircraft.AFTER flight captain call bos airport tower assist supervise.HE say THEY WERE pull THE tape FOR REVIEW.
625~I check OUT A certificatedflightinstructor APPLICANT IN SPIN train AS A FAVOR FOR ANOTHER certificatedflightinstructor.THE STUDENT look RATHER heavy BUT WE WERE us A _ WITH lowfuel AND I WAS SURE WE WOULD BE OK.THE LESSON WAS excite BUT UNEVENTFUL.AFTER THE flight I DID A weightandbalance AND FOUND THAT WHILE WE WERE ON THE UTILITY CATEGORY WE WERE OUT OF THE envelop FOR THE frontseat.CAUSE WHEN ask TO checkout THE STUDENT certificatedflightinstructor THERE WERE sever OTHER PEOPLE PRESENT.PEER PRESSURE EGO AND NOT want TO EMBARRASS THE STUDENT OVERCAME MY COMMON SENSE.prevent IF THERE IS ani DOUBT DO A weightandbalance FIRST.
626~WHILE climb TO _ feet turn TO _ degree head hear airtrafficcontrol ADVISE aircraftnumber _ OF OUR posit.I note hi posit AT approximate _ o'clock posit ABOUT _ mile climb ON THE trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _.I look OVER MY left SHOULDER TO LOCATE aircraftnumber _ AND SAW HIM ON A converge head.OUR trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _ GAVE resolutionadvisory TO descend AT MORE THAN _ FPM AND I turn wing LEVEL descend AND THEN turn TO THE right.aircraftnumber _ SILL claim HE HAD US IN SIGHT abrupt turn left BELLY UP TO US.THIS AGGRESSIVE maneuver WAS NECESSARY TO AVOID US.WE keep HIM IN SIGHT entiretime follow trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _ guide BUT FEEL THAT OUR TURN AWAY FROM THE traffic WAS NECESSARY TO AVOID CONTACT.IF HE INDEED HAD US IN SIGHT HE WAS SLOW TO AVOID US.OUR aircraft WAS NEVER notify OF THAT traffic UNTIL AFTER WE query THE control AFTER avoid THE CONFLICT.I BELIEVE THAT THE CONFLICT WAS cause BY THE control vector aircraftnumber _ INAPPROPRIATELY WITHOUT altitude separate AND BY aircraftnumber _ NOT see AND avoid OUR aircraft.supplementalinformation FROM airborneclassificationnumber _ WE WERE instrumentmeteorologicalconditions.depart HAD give THIS aircraft A _ WHICH TOOK OFF immediate AFTER US AN early _ degree weatheravoidance VECTOR AND PUT HIM INSIDE OUR flight PATH.ALSO hi climb perform WAS BETTER THAN our.SO WITH THIS APPARENT THE control ask THE _ IF HE HAD US visual.HE reply affirm.THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE RADIO EXCHANGE THE _ continue ON A collisioncourse.WHEN WE CAME OUT OF THE cloud WE SAW THE _ AT _ mile close.HE AND THE control HAD THEIR RADIO EXCHANGE AND THE control assure US HE HAD US IN SIGHT AND WOULD MAINTAIN visualseparation.ONLY HE DIDN T.HE turn BELLY UP ON THE collisioncourse AND WE pull THE power TO IDLE push OVER AND pull TO THE north TO AVOID A collide.HE cross OUR flight PATH direct OVER THE TOP OF OUR _ AT approximate _ feet ABOVE US.I TOLD THE control TO SAVE THE tape AND hi supervise IS investigate.
627~THERE WAS confuse between THE cockpitcrew AND airtrafficcontrol AS TO WHETHER THE CREW WAS actual clear FOR THE profiledescent ON THE CIVET arrive.airtrafficcontrol clear US FOR THE CIVET arrive TO lax airport.WE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THAT TO MEAN clear TO descend AND TO WHAT altitude.UPON question THE control AS TO WHEN WE COULD descend THEY say YOU WERE clear TO descend.BY THIS TIME WE WOULD BE HIGH ON THE cross restrict AT CIVET.THE airtrafficcontrolcontroller say OK THAT WE WILL BE OK TO BE HIGH ON THE CIVET PROFILE.SOLUTION WHEN airtrafficcontrol clear US FOR THE CIVET arrive THEY SHOULD ALSO clear US FOR THE descend OUT OF OUR CURRENT altitude.MAKE IT clear AND ELIMINATE THE confuse.
628~WHILE fly THE ST CLAIR _ depart FROM dtw airport TO pwm airport encounter severeturbulence DURING climbout OVER PISTA intersect.LOST flightdirector autopilot THRUST rate PANEL AND autothrottle.GOT clearance TO _ feet AND A TURN TO THE west.fly rawdata TO _ feet attempt numeroustimes TO REACQUIRE flightdirector.ONCE IN smoothair WAS ABLE TO GET system component BACK.I DID NOT DECLARE AN emergency NOR DID I SUSPECT ani structuraldamage TO aircraft.GALLEY CABIN report NO injury.I return TO dtw airport AFTER inform airtrafficcontrol OF pilotreport AND DISPATCH.land AT dtw airport uneventful.THE turbulent encounter WAS NOT FORECAST NOR WAS IT associate WITH ani convectiveactivity IN THE AREA.
629~perform ACTUAL automate land category IIIB approach runway lax airport.runwayvisualrangetouchdown _ feet MID _ feet ROLLOUT _ feet.DURING ROLLOUT airtrafficcontrol direct US TO MAKE right turnoff OF taxiway M.THAT WAS OUR PLAN AS WE understand taxiway K WAS close.DURING decelerate WE SAW THE GREEN turnofflight TAXI assume IT WAS taxiway M BECAUSE WE THOUGHT WE pass taxiway K WE MADE THE right TURN.BY THE TIME WE WERE _ WAY ONTO THE taxiway WE realize IT WAS INDEED taxiway K.tower TOLD US WE WERE ON taxiway K AND HAD follow me TRUCK clear THE taxiway SO THAT WE COULD PROCEED TO THE GATE.IN real taxiway K WAS NOT close IT WAS light FOR TAXI AND THERE WERE NO barricade OR obstruct.IT WAS SO fog THAT WE assume taxiway K WAS taxiway M.THERE WERE NO problem WITH tower.NO delay JUST A misunderstand ON THE TURNOFF.IF taxiway K WAS INDEED close THE TURNOFF TAXI greenlight SHOULD HAVE BEEN turn OFF WITH A FORM OF light BARRICADE TO ENHANCE THE FACT THAT IT WAS close.WE IN THE FOG decelerate ON ROLLOUT mistake THE WELL light taxiway FOR taxiway M.EVEN THE SIGNAGE WAS HARD TO SEE.
630~MY firstofficer WAS fly AND HE WAS NEW.THE weather WAS WORSE THAN automaticterminalinformationservice call FOR.THE firstofficer WENT fullscale ON THE instrumentlandingsystem locate SO I TOOK THE aircraft AND WENT ON THE goaraound.turbulent WAS ABOVE MODERATE AND MY firstofficer FROZE.I ask FOR flap AND GEAR TWICE AND I TOLD tower WE WERE ON THE GO SINCE MY firstofficer COULD NOT.IT WAS DIFFICULT TO TAKE THE aircraft AND DO ALL THE ABOVE IN THE turbulent BUT WE I manage lucky.tower GAVE US A head AND altitude WE land _ minute LATER.
631~rent _ FOR SOLO PRACTICE AT AN fixedbaseoperator OTHER THAN MY homeairport.AFTER takeoffrunway _ AND come OUT OF crosswind TURN TO left ACT WAS sudden HARD TO control YAW AND A largeamount OF RUDDER NECESSARY TO HOLD direct.clear OF traffic I land ON AN inactiverunway _.preoccupy WITH THE problem I fail TO NOTIFY airtrafficcontrol WHILE IN THE AIR AND ALSO ONCE ON THE ground NOT be SURE OF WHAT TO SAY OVER THE RADIO ABOUT IT.GOT permit AND taxi BACK TO THE fixedbaseoperator.AFTER land I figure THE TRIM HANDLE BASE OF COLUMN pop OUT OF set.report SIT TO THE DESK.THE A and P mechanic RESET HANDLE AND BENT TRIM TAB.WENT backup WITH AN instruct THIS TIME.aircraft fly FINE.AT A LATER TIME I check IN WITH THE tower ON advise OF MY homeairport instruct AND SPOKE TO airtrafficcontrol manage.ALL WAS OK WITH THEM.NO OTHER traffic AT THE TIME ETC.humanperformanceconsideration ETC _ hour checkride WAS require BY THE fixedbaseoperator BEFORE THIS aircraft WAS rent HOWEVER.NOSEWHEEL STRUT NOISE bottom OUT ETC AND WHEN turn.FLAP DETENT WAS WORN OUT ON actuate HANDLE.THIS MODEL WAS THE THIRD OF THE TYPE AND I WAS UNFAMILIAR WITH THE RUDDER TRIM control ON THIS TYPE _ NO TRIM FOR RUDDER ON THE OTHER _ _ south I VE fly.obvious MY percept OF AN IMMINENT control fail WAS WRONG.HAD I BEEN MORE FAMILIAR WITH THIS particularaircraft AND it RUDDER TRIM I JUST WOULD HAVE reach DOWN AND RESET IT.ALSO I forget TO NOTIFY airtrafficcontrol OF problem.have BEEN train IN OTHER emergency SUCH AS engineout FIRE ETC I HAD NOT BEEN train IN anyway TO BE prepare FOR A POSSIBLE control fail.IT TOOK ME BY SURPRISE.be MORE AWARE WHEN rent UNFAMILIAR model OF SAME aircraft WOULD ALSO HAVE help.HOPE THIS report doe.
632~groundcontrol issue A taxiinstruction TO runway _ AND TO HOLD SHORT AT taxiway B runway _ WAS ACTIVE BUT IS TOO SHORT FOR US TO us.runway _ IS general THE activerunway AT MORRISTOWN AND OUT OF HABIT WE CAME TO taxiway B clear BOTH way AND taxi ACROSS THE activerunway.I AM UNDER THE GUN AT WORK BECAUSE I file A complain ABOUT A HOSTILE chiefpilot.SINCE THEN _ week AGO THEY HAVE BEEN fly ME nonstop AND I HAVE BEEN UNDER EXTREME STRESS.I BELIEVE THIS STRESS contribute TO MY LACK OF FOCUS WITH MY pilot duty.THE correctiveaction I PLAN TO TAKE IS TO GET A NEW JOB BEFORE SOMETHING WORSE happen.
633~I WAS call DURING A RESERVE PERIOD TO COVER A flight assign FOR THAT DAY.I HAD begin THE RESERVE PERIOD AT _ THAT morn AND WAS call ON _ hour CALLOUT AT _.WHEN THE schedule describe THE TRIP I assume THAT IT WOULD FINISH AND I WOULD BE release PRIOR TO _ WHICH WOULD MAKE FOR A _ hour dutyday.SO I accept THE assign.WHEN I reach THE airport AND GOT YOUR TRIP PRINTOUT I realize THAT I WOULD NOT BE release UNTIL _.have ALREADY accept THE TRIP I WOULD BE DISCIPLINED IF I TOLD THEM AT THAT LATE TIME THAT I WAS UNABLE TO FLY THE TRIP BECAUSE IT exceed MY DUTY limit.IN add THE COMPANY WAS IN A transit TO COME full INTO comply WITH THE federalaviationregulation regard RESERVE REST.TO ENSURE THAT THIS doe NOT HAPPEN AGAIN I WILL TAKE THE TIME TO GET MORE inform FROM THE CREW schedule regard THE TRIP AND specific THE RELEASE TIME.WITH THAT inform I CAN THEN DECIDE WHETHER IT IS LEGAL OR NOT TO ACCEPT EACH TRIP assign DURING A RESERVE PERIOD.
634~THE aircraft involve HAD BEEN IN maintain THE DAY BEFORE THE flight IN QUESTION FOR A PITOT STATIC block ON THE copilot south SIDE instrument.THE followingmorning ON october _ WE WERE fly FROM alb airport TO aus airport.WE level OFF AT flightlevel direct INTO THE SUN AND notice A DISPARITY between THE captain south AND copilot south altimeter THE copilot south be _ feet high.AS WE WERE discuss THIS airtrafficcontrol query OUR altitude.I respond THAT WE WERE _ feet LOW refer THE captain south ALTIMETER.THE control THEN ask US TO CALL hi supervise AT OUR destinate.THE captain ON THE flight call AND THE control indicate THAT WE WERE _ feet LOW.THIS COULD BE POSSIBLE IN A TRANSIENT CONDITION AS WE WERE BOTH distract FOR A FEW second.UPON return TO alb airport THE aircraft WAS turn OVER TO maintain AND IT WAS discover THAT THE copilot south ALTIMETER WAS LEFT IN STANDBY cause IT TO INDICATE high THAN THE captain south ALTIMETER.

704~I allow _ jumpseatrider onboard on WAS IN THE COCKPIT AND on IN THE CABIN.AFTER takeoff I realize THAT THE particularaircraft WE WERE IN DID NOT HAVE A SEATBELT AT THE SECOND observe south locate therefor I COULD ONLY CARRY _ jumpseatrider PER companypolicy.
705~ON THE ground AT XYZ I WAS prepare TO TAXI.I receive MY taxiinstruction FROM THE groundcontrol WHO WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND DUE TO BLEEDOVER FROM automaticterminalinformationservice ONTO THE groundfrequency.I WAS TOLD TO TAXI TO runway _.I begin TO TAXI AND realize I miss THE taxiway A WHICH I near.I stop PRIOR TO reach AN intersect AT runway _ AND WAS prepare TO CALL groundcontrol WHEN groundcontrol contact ME AND TOLD ME TO HOLD MY posit WHICH I DID.I THEN receive OTHER instruct WHICH WERE unread DUE TO THE BLEEDOVER FROM automaticterminalinformationservice.I relay THAT inform TO THE groundcontrol THAT SHE WAS unread.I WAS THEN contact BY THE towercontroller AND TOLD TO backtaxi ONTO runway _ AND clear FOR takeoff.I NEVER cross ONTO THE activerunway UNTIL instruct TO DO SO.I THINK THIS COULD HAVE BEEN resolve HAD I receive A progressivetaxi FROM THE groundcontrol.HOWEVER ALL instruct WERE VERY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND WITH THE BLEEDOVER FROM automaticterminalinformationservice.HAD I receive A progressivetaxi AND THE BLEEDOVER correct THE SIT COULD HAVE BEEN avoid.THERE WAS NO CONFLICT WITH arrive depart OR taxiingaircraft.
706~IN CRUISE flight approach cmh airport.center HAD give US A VECTOR IN prepare FOR THE descend INTO cmh airport.apparent AND UNKNOWN TO US THERE WAS ANOTHER flight WITH A near IDENTICAL callsign ON THE frequency.airtrafficcontrol issue A clearance TO descend TO flightlevel AND BECAUSE THE initialpart OF THE callsign WAS clip ALL I hear WAS WHAT sound LIKE MY callsign descend TO flightlevel.I acknowledge THE descentclearance AND call depart flightlevel TO flightlevel.approximateflightlevel airtrafficcontrol call US AND ask US TO STATE OUR altitude WHICH WE DID.I WAS THEN instruct TO LEVEL AT flightlevel AND inform THAT THE descentclearance WAS FOR ANOTHER aircraft.short THEREAFTER HE AGAIN issue ANOTHER clearance TO THE OTHER aircraft AND AGAIN hi transmit WAS initial clip AND THE callsign sound exact LIKE our.THIS TIME I ask IF THE clearance WAS FOR US AND WAS inform THAT IT WAS NOT.I inform THE control THAT hi transmit WERE clip AND THAT THEY WERE come OUT sound LIKE OUR callsign.THE NEXT _ mission include A REPEAT OF THE companycallsign ALONG WITH THE flightnumber.WE WERE inform THAT NO LOSS OF separate TOOK PLACE.I call THE airtrafficcontrol center AND discuss THE SIT WITH THEM.apparent THE control WAS NEW AND HE DID NOT FOLLOW THE establish procedure WHEN contact US TO LET US KNOW ANOTHER aircraft WITH A similarcallsign WAS ON THE frequency AND HE ALSO DID NOT REPEAT THE companycallsign follow OUR flightnumber AS PER THEIR procedure.IN add HE miss MY acknowledge OF THE clearance.give THE circumstance THAT WE WERE expect A descentclearance THIS WAS WHY WE WERE ON THE VECTOR AND THAT THE firstofficer WAS OFF THE airtrafficcontrolfrequency obtain THE automaticterminalinformationservice AND contact operate I AM NOT SURE THAT THE samething WOULD NOT HAVE happen TO ANYONE ELSE.I know THAT I WAS BY MYSELF ON THE frequency AND I WAS be particular ATTENTIVE TO radiocall AT THAT busytime AND EVEN AFTER THE MISTAKE WAS MADE AND WITH NOT ONLY THE firstofficer AND A COMPANY jumpseat pilot listen THE VERY NEXT transmit FROM THE airtrafficcontrolcontroller TO THE OTHER aircraft WAS SO CLOSE IN SOUND TO OUR callsign THAT I HAD TO CALL airtrafficcontrol AND specific REQUEST HIM TO REPEAT JUST exact TO WHOM HE WAS call SO WE COULD BE SURE THAT IT WAS NOT FOR US.follow THAT REQUEST HE THEN start repeat THE companyname AFTER THE flightnumber AND NO FURTHER misunderstand occur.
707~CREW WAS distract BY OTHER duty AND begin descend LATE.OUR clearance WAS TO CROSS _ mile south OF FAK AT _ feet WE cross _ mile OUT OF _ feet.THERE WAS NO traffic OR trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _ CONFLICT.airtrafficcontrol DID NOT INQUIRE ABOUT descend intent UNTIL IT WAS TOO LATE TO MAKE OUR cross restrict.A headsup FROM airtrafficcontrol WHEN HE SHOULD HAVE know FROM EXPERIENCE THAT WE need TO BEGIN OUR descend WOULD HAVE BEEN help.
708~aircraft Y AN _ depart acy airport NJ.HE want AN IMMEDIATE climb TO flightlevel.I WAS ONLY ABLE TO GIVE HIM flightlevel.I TOLD HIM TO EXPECT high AROUND standby AND switch HIM TO THE nextcontroller.aircraft X IN CARJ WAS _ mile south OF MY BOUNDARY ON MY frequency.aircraft X advise HE HAD A trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _ resolutionadvisory AND WAS climb.I TOLD HIM THE traffic WAS AN _ AND I WAS NOT SURE IF HE WAS actual climb.I THEN observe THE _ south altitude INDICATE flightlevel AND _ mile FROM aircraft Y.THE nextcontroller advise ME aircraft X _ climb WITHOUT A clearance.NO OTHER aircraft WERE involve.THE aircraft X _ WAS IN A BIG HURRY TO climb TO flightlevel.WHEN THE control call traffic TO HIM AT flightlevel HE say I HAVE THE traffic radarcontact.AND THEN climb TO flightlevel RIGHT UNDER THE traffic.

739~AFTER land tower clear aircraft TO TAXI TO park.tower WAS work BOTH tower AND groundcontrol.I enter A taxiway THAT WAS NOT notice to airman ED mention ON automaticterminalinformationservice OR mention BY tower ground AND ONLY AFTER taxi sever hundredfeet FOUND barricade close AT THE ENTRANCE TO fixedbaseoperatorramp.I attempt TO TURN ONTO A SHORT STUB taxiway THAT lead TO A RAMP us BY ANOTHER fixedbaseoperator.AS I attempt TO COMPLETE uturn FROM closedtaxiway TO STUB taxiway TO RAMP THE left MAIN land GEAR WENT INTO SOFT TURF border taxiway.I immediate stop THE aircraft.THE flight TECHNICIAN AND I GOT OFF THE aircraft TO SURVEY THE SIT.THE aircraft travel ABOUT _ feet INTO THE SOFT TURF AND HAD SUNK ABOUT _ inch.I return TO THE COCKPIT AND shutdown THE engine.OUR fixedbaseoperator SENT A TUG OUT TO THE aircraft AND push US BACK ON THE taxiway posit THE aircraft SO IT COULD BE taxi WITHOUT FURTHER maneuver.OUR flight TECHNICIAN AN A and p ia inspect THE aircraft PRIOR TO FURTHER flight.THE wholeincident WAS OVER IN ABOUT _ minute.THE tower complain THAT THE CITY HAD close THE taxiway WITHOUT PROPER notify HENCE NO notice to airman automaticterminalinformationservice ETC.THE tower ALSO mention THAT sever OTHER aircraft HAD HAD TROUBLE WITH THE closedtaxiway.I DON T KNOW THE PROTOCOL FOR inform THE federalaviationadministration ABOUT airport inform BUT IT seem THE righthand IS NOT talk TO THE lefthand.IF tower AND ground HAD BEEN operate BY SEPARATE PEOPLE THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN TIME TO ALERT US.
740~clear FOR A VISUAL approach.UPON land WE WERE NOT ABLE TO CONTACT THE tower.WE switch radio AND WERE ABLE TO ESTABLISH communicate WITH THE tower.I WAS NOT ABLE TO posit STATE THAT WE HAD BEEN clear TO LAND.POSSIBLE radioproblem OR POSSIBLE fail TO check IN WITH THE tower.FATIGUE WAS A FACTOR.WE HAD AN _ morn check in AND I HAD NOT sleep WELL.SOLUTION AVOID EARLY check in.
741~A miss approach WAS start AT THE outermarker WHEN THE captain notice THE glideslope receive WAS inoperative.AT THE sametime THE right engine flame OUT captain WAS give A clearance TO _ feet.WHILE try TO RESTART THE engine THE aircraft climb TO AN altitude OF _ feet.AT THAT TIME WE WERE reclear TO _ feet.
742~aircraft WAS clear TO phx airport ON rno airport depart.AT _ feet aircraft WAS turn TO INTERCEPT airway OVER FMG collocate veryhighfrequencyomnidirectionalradiorange and tacticalairnavigation INSTEAD OF maintain head AND wait FOR radarvector TO INTERCEPT airway.sensitive TO mountainousterrain NOTWITHSTANDING I SOMEHOW GOT IT INTO MY THOUGHT I WAS suppose TO INTERCEPT airway OVER FMG.WHEN query BY THE control I ask FOR A head AND WAS assign A _ degree head TO INTERCEPT airway south OF FMG collocate veryhighfrequencyomnidirectionalradiorange and tacticalairnavigation.THE flight proceed uneventful TO phx airport.
743~aircraft maintenancehistory reveal AN flightmanagementsystem mapshift _ day PRIOR TO OUR flight.THE aircraft HAD fly _ leg THIS DAY PRIOR TO OUR flight WITH NO problem NOR ani note AFTER THE writeup.NEVERTHELESS IN add TO NORMAL standardoperatingprocedure MAP confirm PRIOR TO us flightmanagementsystem FOR navigate I monitor OUR COURSE INTERCEPT ON THE BUCKEYE TWO depart phx airport WITH rawdata display us lateralnavigation engage.EVERYTHING indicate THE flightmanagementsystem WAS operate correct.NO problem WERE note enroute.ON THE left TURN TO INTERCEPT runway AT lax airport FROM PDZ _ degree RADIAL HOWEVER _ TOLD US TO CONTINUE OUR TURN TO _ degree _ degree IS THE COURSE TO INTERCEPT THE locate.I switch TO rawdata TO FIND THE locate offscale.rawdata WAS NOT us TO THIS POINT BECAUSE WE HAD NOT BEEN clear FOR THE approach AND WE WERE MORE THAN _ mile FROM THE FIELD WHICH require BOTH radio BE IN automate TO INSURE flightmanagementcomputer UPDATE.THE system flightmanagementsystem WAS check BY maintain AT lax airport WITH NO problem FOUND.ON THE nextleg enroute navigate lateralnavigation work FINE YET WE DID NOTE A mapshift short AFTER WE WENT FROM automate TO MANUAL FOR THE FINAL approach INTO OAK approximate _ mile.WHY THIS happen AT lax airport WITH BOTH veryhighfrequencyomnidirectionalradiorange switch IN automate CAN ONLY BE POSTULATED THAT BOTH radio LOST veryhighfrequencyomnidirectionalradiorange LOCK AND THE inertialreferencesystem drift.supplementalinformation FROM airborneclassificationnumber _ ON PARADISE _ arrive INTO lax airport flightmanagementcomputer MAP DISPLAY drift approximate _ nauticalmile.NOT recognize UNTIL approachcontrol vector US BACK TO FINAL.flightmanagementcomputer display ON COURSE WHICH WAS INCORRECT.WE fly remain IN rawdata.MAY HAVE BEEN cause BY A SOFTWARE BUG IN THE recent update DATABASE.flightmanagementcomputer MAP error ARE SOMEWHAT INSIDIOUS.
744~ON descend WE WERE give A cross restrict TO CROSS _ mile south OF MAD AT OR BELOW _ feet.ON descend WE WERE distract WITH A CALL FROM A flightattendant ABOUT vibrate THEY feel IN THE aircraft WHICH WAS ALSO feel ON takeoff.THE vibrate WAS DUE TO THE auxiliarypowerunit DOOR NOT close.AFTER distract WE notice THAT WE WERE go TO MISS THE cross restrict AT _ mile south MAD MADE cross restrict AT _ feet ZBW ask ABOUT restrict TOLD THEM WE WERE do THE BEST WE COULD AND MADE _ feet AT ABOUT _ mile south OF MAD.auxiliarypowerunit DOOR WAS AN OPEN defer writeup.
745~receive AN resolutionadvisory ON trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _ AS LEARJET pass OUR _ o'clock posit AT flightlevel.WE WERE AT flightlevel.trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _ command US TO descend WITH resolutionadvisory TARGET indicate IN OUR _ o'clock posit.descend AT _ feet WHICH violate separate ON THE LEAR.airtrafficcontrol say THERE WAS NO OTHER traffic IN THE VICINITY EXCEPT THE LEAR.notify ME THE tape WERE be pull FOR REVIEW.THEY HAVE ALSO file IT AS AN INCIDENT.WE AS A CREW DID EVERYTHING WE WERE train TO DO WE MUST ALWAYS FOLLOW trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _ WHEN visualcontact CANNOT BE MADE.HOWEVER THIS seem LIKE IT MAY HAVE BEEN FALSE.
746~SFQ MY homeairport HAS _ runway.FOR _ week THE automaticterminalinformationservice HAS report _ nondirectionalbeacon DECOMMISSIONED _ runway _ close _ runway _ locate OUT.ON THE DATE OF THE occur runway _ WAS add AS ALSO close.I fail TO NOTE THIS AND land ON runway _ WHICH THE WIND favor.I HAD BECOME SO accustom TO THE SAME _ automaticterminalinformationservice message THAT I ONLY note WIND DATA.IT WAS A LESSON IN inattentive._ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ THE pilot report THAT THE automaticterminalinformationservice contain length airport equip OTS AND runway close FOR AN upcome EVENT.THIS HAD BEEN THIS WAY FOR sever day AND result IN THE pilot listen ONLY FOR THE wind AND altimetersetting.THE CLOSURE OF THE runway fail TO CATCH hi attention.THE CLOSURE WAS FOR operate NEAR THE runway AND NOT BECAUSE THE SURFACE WAS UNUSABLE.runway close mark ONLY CAUGHT THE pilot south attention AFTER HE WAS commit TO THE land.
747~high experience firstofficer observe WHAT HE believe TO BE AN IMMINENT trafficconflict.HE manual override THE autopilot TO TURN left.passenger AND CREW WERE startle AS THIS WAS AN AGGRESSIVE MANEUVER.THE perceive CONFLICT WAS A RESULT OF MISINTERP OF THE ACTUAL DISTANCE between US AND ANOTHER aircraft.THE firstofficer react BECAUSE HE THOUGHT THERE WAS A GENUINE safe CONCERN AND collide POTENTIAL.A PA WAS MADE explain THE REASON FOR THE MANEUVER.THE firstofficer NEVER deviate FROM assignedaltitude immediate realize hi MISJUDGEMENT AND work WITH ME TO RETURN THE aircraft ON COURSE.NO report WAS MADE TO airtrafficcontrol BECAUSE NO CONFLICT exist.
748~I depart fdk airport WITH intent OF overfly THE CITY OF THERMONT AND STAY JUST west OF THE _ AREA.I WAS plan TO FOLLOW _ north highway north OUT OF FREDERIC immediate AS I depart runway _.I mistake follow A MORE west highway _ west FOR ABOUT _ mile OR SO.realize MY ERROR I turn ABOUT _ degree TO INTERCEPT THE FREDERIC _ degree RADIAL.WELL NOT have ani distancemeasuringequipment AT THE fdk airport veryhighfrequencyomnidirectionalradiorange AND have A problem WITH THE MECHANICAL CONDITION OF MY indicate ON THE navigate RADIO I WAS NOT comfort THAT I HAD possible pass OVER THE _ AREA DURING MY COURSE CHANGE TO THE northeast.THE REMEDY TO THE SIT WOULD HAVE BEEN TO FLY THE COMPASS north OUT OF fdk airport AND us BETTER PILOTAGE TO FIND THERMONT IN add TO us A RADIAL OUT OF electromagneticinterference TO VERIFY MY posit AND STAY clear OF _ WOULD HAVE help.
749~UPON get CLOSE TO THE airport WE DID A simulatedengine fail.WE simulate go THROUGH THE appropriateemergency checklist FOR AN enginefailure.WE WENT THROUGH THE BEFORE land check AND decide TO LEAVE gearup AND flap UP TILL WE WERE assure OF make IT TO THE airport.WE MADE left traffic FOR runway _.WHEN turn FINAL WE WERE STILL slight HIGH SO THE pilot initiate sturn TO LOSE SOME altitude.AT THAT TIME THE WORKLOAD WAS get HIGH.I WAS make THE radiocall.I SAW HIM PUT DOWN flap AND THOUGHT THE GEAR WAS DOWN.WE THEN land ON runway AND slide TO A STOP.THE aircraft DID NOT SUSTAIN substantialdamage AND IS NOT report UNDER nationaltransportationsafetyboard _.
750~fly INTO trafficpattern altitude receive CALL FROM flightattendant THAT WE HAD A passenger IN SEAT XX WHO WAS have CHEST pain AND WAS be see BY _ doctor THAT WERE ON THE aircraft.WE declare A medicalemergency AND BELOW _ feet WE WENT _ knot TO GET TO THE airport fast.FIRE crew WERE ON THE JETBRIDGE TO MEET THE aircraft AND HE WAS take OFF WITHOUT FURTHER event.THE flightcrew DID A greatjob AND help WITH EVERYTHING I need.
751~WHILE ON A DEADHEAD flight FROM SALEM TO PORTLAND OR THE firstofficer WAS fly.WE WERE TOLD TO CONTACT center.WE WERE clear IN OUR clearance TO _ feet.center call traffic FOR US.WE TOLD THEM WE WERE instrumentmeteorologicalconditions.THEY TOLD US TO MAINTAIN _ feet.I THEN WENT TO communicate number _ TO GET automaticterminalinformationservice AT PORTLAND.WHILE I WAS do THAT THE firstofficer HAD THE aircraft ON autopilot AND THEN push THE transfer BUTTON TO SHIFT THE autopilot TO hi SIDE.THE altitude SELECT BUTTON WAS push AND THE firstofficer say HE THOUGHT THE autopilot WOULD CAPTURE THE altitude OF _ feet.HE say IT WENT TO _ feet THEN HE push IT DOWN AND BACK TO _ feetmeansealevel.HE say HE WAS surprise HOW FAST IT WAS climb AND IT surprise HIM WHEN THE altitude SELECT DIDN T STOP THE climb AT _ feet.MY attention WAS divert WHILE I WAS get automaticterminalinformationservice.MY firstclue THAT WE HAD A problem WAS WHEN center GAVE ME A phonenumber TO CALL.I THINK ANOTHER THING THAT COULD HAVE BEEN A problem IS WHEN THE firstofficer HIT THE transfer BUTTON HE ALSO push THE turbulent BUTTON WHICH WOULD MAKE THE altitude CAPTURE MODE LESS SENSITIVE I AM TOLD.I M NOT SURE IF THE turbulent BUTTON WAS push.
752~ON descend WE discover A problem WITH THE MECHANICAL digit READOUT OF OUR head select.DURING CRUISE WHILE THE autopilot WAS receive navigate guide FROM THE in THE captain AND flightengineer DID SOME troubleshoot OF THE problem SO THAT AN AML ENTRY COULD BE MADE.DURING THIS PROCESS apparent THE head selectorknob WAS push IN cause THE aircraft TO GO INTO head HOLD.AS THE pilotflying I DID NOT RECOGNIZE THIS.overtime DUE TO change wind AND vary WE drift left OF COURSE.THE flightengineer actual notice THIS note THAT THE coursedeviationindicator BAR WAS NOT center.AT THAT TIME I realize WE WERE IN head HOLD.WE immediate correct BACK TO THE AIRWAY.I ESTIMATE THAT WE WERE approximate _ mile OFF COURSE.IT IS VERY EASY TO BECOME COMPLACENT TOWARD navigate WHEN YOU OPERATE WITH A GOOD autopilot AND in.WHEN YOU COUPLE IT UP IT fly THE rout VERY precis.IN THE FUTURE I WILL ENSURE THAT THE aircraft IS STILL IN THE plan MODE AFTER ANYONE touch ani TYPE autopilot control.I WILL ALSO TRY TO BE MORE vigil AS THE pilotflying TO THE flight MODE annunciate DURING CRUISE.I TAKE A LOT OF pain TO STAY ON TOP OF navigate us chart AND NAVAIDS BUT OUT overwater THIS ERROR slip BY ME.
753~WE aircraft X WERE clear TO climb flightlevel readback altitudeclearance.UPON LEVELOFF GOT trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _ trafficadvisory THEN resolutionadvisory resolutionadvisory TO descend AND MONITOR verticalspeed.captain HAD visualcontact WITH AN aircraft WHILE adhere TO resolutionadvisory.airtrafficcontrol THEN notify US OF traffic THEN WE advise airtrafficcontrol OF CONFLICT AND THAT captain HAD aircraft IN SIGHT.OTHER aircraft pilot DID THE SAME.OTHER aircraft apparent WAS clear TO flightlevel AS WELL.LATER WE WERE TOLD airtrafficcontrol mistake clear US BOTH TO flightlevel.
754~WHILE cruise AT flightlevel A TARGET WAS observe ON THE outeredge OF THE trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _ SCREEN AT approximate _ o'clock TO MY posit.THAT WAS follow short BY A trafficadvisory.THE TARGET WAS close AND WAS _ feet BELOW THEN I receive AN resolutionadvisory TO descend AND TURN left WHICH I DID.THE TARGET WAS STILL close AND show _ feet LOW THEN samealtitude.TARGET pass OFF THE right AT approximate _ mile OR LESS AS observe ON trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _.I level OFF AT flightlevel AND climb BACK TO flightlevel.I advise airtrafficcontrol OF THE resolutionadvisory AND THE control advise THAT HE HAD NOTHING IN OUR VICINITY EXCEPT AN aircraft AT flightlevel WHICH WE COULD SEE.I NEVER MADE A visualcontact WITH THE TARGET THAT cause THE resolutionadvisory OTHER THAN ON trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _.ALSO I NEVER receive A clear OF CONFLICT advise FROM trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _.THE TARGET JUST disappear TO THE right REAR OF OUR posit ON THE trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _ SCREEN.
755~A MALFUNCTION OF THE maincabin cargodoor LOCK indicate system WAS discover.WITH THE maincabin cargodoor FULL OPEN THE forwarddoor LOCK indicate lock THE LIGHT WAS extinguish.THE control panellight WERE test AND THE LIGHT check GOOD.maintain DMI ED THE MALFUNCTION AND A VISUAL check WAS conduct AS PER THE minimumequipmentlist.AFTER takeoff THE refer WAS check IN great DETAIL AND WAS FOUND TO BE IMPROPER FOR THE TYPE OF MALFUNCTION.THE CREW feel THE DOOR WAS SAFE TO CONTINUE THE flight BUT BELIEVE THE flight SHOULD NOT HAVE depart BECAUSE THE minimumequipmentlist refer state THAT A visualinspection SHOULD BE MADE BUT ONLY IF THE FILAMENT HAD fail _ minimumequipmentlist _ STEP _.THE MALFUNCTION SHOULD HAVE BEEN correct PRIOR TO flight.
756~THE INCIDENT occur DURING TAXI INTO A parkingspace WHEN THE left WING CAME IN CONTACT WITH A light POST ADJACENT TO THE parkingarea.minordamage WAS DONE TO THE left OUTER WING.THE problem WAS cause BY LACK OF attention TO THE left SIDE OF THE PLANE WHEN park.I WAS look TO THE right SIDE TO TURN INTO THE parkingspace WHEN THE left WING bump THE LIGHT POST.THE PLANE WAS move VERY slow AT THE TIME OF CONTACT.THE INCIDENT COULD HAVE BEEN prevent IF I WOULD HAVE maintain MY posit ON THE taxiline UNTIL exact IN FRONT OF THE parkingspot AND BY MORE attention TO THE left SIDE.
757~_ minute AFTER takeoff ALL light WENT OFF.emergency light CAME ON FOR A FEW second AND THEN WENT OFF.flightattendant number _ GOT HER FLASHLIGHT AND WE us IT TO HELP passenger RETURN TO THEIR seat.THE STOWAGE FOR MY LUGGAGE IS IN AN overheadbin AND MY TOTE baggage HAD BEEN move BY A passenger therefor I COULD NOT FIND IT.THE INTERPHONES WERE NOT work SO I MADE MY WAY TO THE FRONT AND WAS TOLD BY THE PURSER TO ROUND UP THE CREW FOR A brief SO I DID.SHE say WE WOULD BE return TO bos airport FOR A NORMAL land.THE light CAME BACK ON AND THE captain MADE AN announce TO THE EFFECT THAT EVERYTHING WAS complete BACK TO NORMAL BUT WE WOULD BE return TO bos airport AS A PRECAUTION.WE land IN bos airport WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT AND change equip.
758~AFTER sever year OF be AN INACTIVE instrumentflightrules pilot I secure AN instrumentflightrules competent check.DURING MY FIRST instrumentflightrulesflight I MAY HAVE climb INTO THE ORD terminalcontrolarea classb WHILE await MY instrumentflightrulesclearance AFTER A visualflightrules takeoff.airtrafficcontrol MADE NO CONTACT WITH ME BUT AFTER review A visualflightrules CHART I WAS LEFT WITH REASON FOR CONCERN AS MY depart TO THE east THEN head north PUT ME IN THE large terminalcontrolarea SECTOR CLOSE TO _ airport.TO PREVENT A FUTURE CONCERN OVER THIS MATTER I WILL KEEP A visualflightrules section HANDY EVEN WHEN ON AN instrumentflightrulesflight PLAN.
759~CHAIN OF event _ turn ON wrongairway._ BLUE MAGIC mark TO HIGHLIGHT BLUE airway._ center turn US BACK ON COURSE._ IMMEDIATE TURN.flight _ AT _ feet clear OVER BAF airway TO INTERCEPT _.WE WERE assign _ degree head TO INTERCEPT airway BUT flightlevel pilotflying mismark hi CHART AND intercept airway ignition _ degree.AFTER roll OUT ON INBOUND TO ignition center ask US WHERE WE WERE go.ON realize OUR MISTAKE firstofficer turn right BANK TO _ degree head AND RESET TO INTERCEPT THE CORRECT AIRWAY.center THEN clear US BACK TO _ degree head AND pilotflying assume center desire US TO INTERCEPT THE origin clear rout AND turn TO INTERCEPT airway.center notice THE TURN AND advise US THEY STILL want US ON THE assignedheading.short THEREAFTER center turn US DIRECT TO SAX SLOW TO _ knot AND descend TO _ feet.EVERYTHING proceed normal THEREAFTER.captain WAS get automaticterminalinformationservice AND GATE inform FROM operate DURING THE navigate problem.supplementalinformation FROM airborneclassificationnumber _ CHAIN OF event humanperformanceconsideration NEXT TO lastleg AT END OF longday WITH ALMOST _ hour DEAD TIME between leg _ legday.mark CHART WITH BLUE feel TIP highlight WHICH DIDN T STAND OUT AGAINST CHART background IN lightingcondition.flight _.WE WERE clear OVER BAF _ THENCE airway TO INTERCEPT airway TO SAX _ THEN DIRECT ewr airport BUT firstofficer pilotflying mismark hi CHART AND intercept airway ignition _ WHILE fly AN assign _ degree head TO INTERCEPT airway THE clear rout.immediate AFTER roll OUT ON THE INBOUND TO ignition center ask US WHERE WE WERE go.immediate AFTER realize THE MISTAKE pilotflying roll right BACK TO _ degree AND BOTH pilot RESET THE NAVAIDS TO INTERCEPT THE CORRECT AIRWAY.center assign US A _ degree head AND pilotflying reintercept THE CORRECT AIRWAY WHEREUPON center advise US WE WERE STILL ON AN assignedheading AND NOT clear TO INTERCEPT.center THEN clear US DIRECT TO SAX SLOW TO _ knot AND descend TO _ feet.EVERYTHING proceed normal THEREAFTER.
760~climb THROUGH flightlevel WITH _ SET IN ALTIMETER AND autopilot hook TO MY ALTIMETER.captain south ALTIMETER WAS SET TO _ BUT WE WERE BOTH BUSY AND MINE stay ON local set.WE end UP _ feet HIGH BEFORE I level disconnect THE autopilot AND descend TO flightlevel AGAIN.THE LEG FROM SITKA TO KETCHIKAN WAS SHORT AND I HAVEN T BEEN THERE FOR A WHILE.
761~I WAS depart FROM MILWAUKEE GENERAL MITCHELL FIELD.weather WAS visualflightrules visible GOOD.I WAS visualflightrules TO airreservebase.MY instrumentstudent pilot WAS fly THE aircraft AND I WAS communicate WITH clearance ground tower.I aircraft X pick UP A clearance OUT OF THE classcairspace.I THEN contact ground WAS give taxiinstruction TO runway _.DURING TAXI I WAS ask TO contacttower WHEN READY FOR takeoff.I WAS ALSO issue HOLD SHORT instruct FOR runway _ WHICH I readback.AT THE holdline THERE WAS AN addition aircraft AT THE oppose holdline WHICH WAS give takeoffclearance BEFORE I WAS.AFTER THE aircraft HAD depart I WAS issue A posit AND HOLD runway _.ANOTHER aircraft move UP TO THE holdline ON THE oppositeside OF THE runway.I readback THE posit AND HOLD instruct AND WE start TO TAXI ACROSS THE holdline.AS I DID I look TO THE left AND check THE INBOUND flight PATH AND SAW A LIGHT TWIN aircraft Y ON WHAT I ESTIMATE TO BE A _ mile FINAL FOR runway _.BY THIS TIME I WAS OVER THE holdline BUT NOT ON THE land PORTION OF THE runway.WE immediate stop TAXI AND I ask THE localcontroller TO VERIFY posit AND HOLD FOR OUR aircraft.THE localcontroller repeat posit AND HOLD runway _ FOR OUR aircraft.A COUPLE OF second AFTER HE say THIS THE localcontroller issue A goaraound FOR THE land aircraft.THE land aircraft DID NOT goaraound BUT land ON runway _.ONCE THE land aircraft HAD LEFT THE runway WE WERE give A clearance TO takeoff.THIS WE DID AND THE localcontroller thank US FOR OUR HELP AS HE transfer US TO depart.I HAVE ALWAYS TAUGHT MY student TO LOOK AND check THE INBOUND PATH WHEN taxi ONTO A runway ON EITHER A control OR uncontrolledfield.IN THIS CASE I practice MY OWN teach WHICH avert WHAT MAY HAVE BEEN A seriousaccident.
762~_ mile northwest OF orl airport I LOST MY engine engineout AT approximate _ IN instrumentmeteorologicalconditions RAIN AT _ feet elevate.I TOLD ORLANDO approach THAT I HAD AN emergency LOST engine.I change fueltank AND engage THE BOOSTER SWITCH.THE engine restart.notify approach THAT engine HAD restart.fuelgauge show FULL AND preflight show FULL.BAD SUMP VALVE AND clog VENT HAD drain THE right MAIN inflight BUT NOT register ON THE GAUGE.HAD system repair UPON land.
763~AFTER work FOR MORE THAN _ hour OF DUTY WE start THE _ LEG flight instrumentlandingsystem INTO mdw airport.THE control TOLD US TO DO _ knot TO THE outermarker AND THEN CALL tower.BECAUSE WE WERE fatigue FROM A longdutyday WE BOTH forget TO CALL THE tower AT THE outermarker AND I maintain AN airspeed OF _ knot.WHEN WE WERE INSIDE THE outermarker WE remember TO CALL tower.AT ABOUT THAT TIME WE call WE BROKE OUT INTO visualflightrules AND WE SAW AN aircraft sit ON THE runway WE WERE land ON.BOTH THE tower AND I initiate A goaraound.contribute factor TOO LONG A dutyday.HOW IT WAS discover BY LUCK.correctiveaction STOP THE DUTY AND FLTS BOTH AT _ hour.flight OR dutytime.I HAVE NEVER see ani pilot THAT GOT ani BETTER AFTER _ hour OF dutytime.IT IS ALWAYS A SLOW DOWNHILL progress OF mistake THAT LEAD TO SITS LIKE THIS.
764~aircraft WAS dispatch WITH _ generate inoperative.THE generate constantspeed DRIVE HAD NOT BEEN disconnect.AS THE flightengineer I question THIS AND refer TO THE defer ITEM BOOK.THE BOOK UNDER maintain south responsible require THAT THE CSD BE disconnect.I bring THIS DISCREPANCY TO THE captain south attention AND THEN call OUR maintain supervise.THE maintain supervise TOLD ME THAT A NEW defer ITEM MANUAL HAD JUST BEEN release AND THAT IT SUPERSEDED MY COPY AND THAT IT ALSO DID NOT REQUIRE THE CSD TO BE disconnect.I inform THE captain OF THIS.AFTER WE HAD push BACK FROM THE GATE AND WERE start THE engine us A SPECIAL checklist FOR _ generate inoperative FOR DISPATCH I reach A NOTE IN THE checklist THAT require THE CSD disconnect LIGHT TO BE illuminate AFTER engine START.THE LIGHT WAS NOT illuminate BECAUSE THE CSD WAS NOT disconnect.I bring THIS TO THE captain south attention.WE determine THAT IT WAS A DISCREPANCY between OUR checklist AND maintain south procedure AND THAT WE WOULD CONTINUE SINCE maintain HAD TOLD US THAT THE CSD DID NOT NEED TO BE disconnect.THE flight WAS conduct uneventful.HOWEVER DURING THE flight I inform THE captain THAT I WOULD PURSUE THE MATTER OF OUR checklist NOT AGREEING WITH THE maintain procedure.I obtain A COPY OF THE NEW mco airport AND FOUND THAT IT IS THE SAME AS THE old VERSION.THE NEW VERSION ALSO call FOR THE CSD TO BE disconnect.maintain AT LEAST ON THIS OCCASION IS incorrect interpret THE mco airport MANUAL procedure.I AM pursue THIS MATTER THROUGH UNION COMPANY channel SO AS TO CORRECT THE problem.AT LEAST _ CREW PRIOR TO US HAD fly THE aircraft IN THE samecondition.IN THE FUTURE IF THERE IS ani DISCREPANCY WITH OUR checklist I WILL GET DEFINITE resolve BEFORE allow THE flight TO CONTINUE.supplementalinformation FROM airborneclassificationnumber _ WE believe THE word OF A maintain supervise WITHOUT see THE CHANGE IN PRINT.WE ALL know THIS DOESN T SEEM quit RIGHT BUT believe IT WAS JUST A PAPERWORK problem.SOLUTION DO IT BY THE BOOK YOU actual HAVE AND CAN READ OR GET A FAX COPY.
765~aircraft WAS ON A flight FROM FORTUNA airport CA TO MONTGOMERY FIELD CA.pilot depart AT _ AND THE estimatedtimeofarrival AT MYF IN _ WAS _.pilot WAS routine switch between THE left AND right fueltank EVERY _ minute.AT approximate _ nauticalmile west OF CRQ airport CA THE engine begin surge AND losingpower.THE aircraft WAS IN CRUISE flight AND THE pilot immediate follow engineout procedure FOR CRUISE flight AS PER THE CESSNA _ operate MANUAL.AFTER NOT be ABLE TO REGAIN fullpower THE pilot decide THE bestcourse OF ACTION WAS TO MAKE AN emergency land AT CRQ airport.THE pilot decide TO KEEP THE aircraft LIGHT ON ONCE A SAFE land WAS assure.A SAFE UNEVENTFUL land WAS MADE AND THE enginepower AND MIXTURE WERE cutoff DURING land ROLLOUT.THE aircraft coast safe OFF THE runway AND ONTO THE paralleltaxiway.THE pilot request IT BE tow TO park.THE aircraft WAS determine TO HAVE _ pound OF FUEL avail FOR flight AT FORTUNA airport CA AFTER subtract _ pound FOR TAXI AND takeoff.IT WAS determine DURING preflight plan THAT IT WOULD TAKE _ pound FOR AN ALMOST DIRECT flight TO MONTGOMERY FIELD _ CA AT _ feet CRUISE altitude.THE FUEL remain WAS TO BE _ pound UPON arrive AT MYF airport.THIS allow FOR THE _ minute RESERVE FOR visualflightrules nightflight.THE wind ALOFT FOR THE rout OF flight vary between _ degree AND _ degree.THE aircraft HAD A TAILWIND THE entireflight AND THE AVERAGE groundspeed WAS _ knot.THE pilot refuel THE aircraft AT CRQ airport AFTER _ hourrestperiod.THE pilot THEN RAN THE engine FOR _ minute TO normal THE FUEL inject system.THE pilot determine THE aircraft TO BE AIRWORTHY AND continue THE flight TO MONTGOMERY FIELD _.THE pilot suspect A POSSIBLE flood engine CONDITION develop DURING emergencyprocedure.
766~clear ON approach TO runway.OTHER aircraft land ON runway.tower request A right _ degree turnon FINAL TO clear aircraft AT END OF runway.I WAS land INTO A SUNSET AND COULD NOT SEE THE END OF THE runway._ jet airline type pass ME ON MY left land ON WHAT appear TO BE runway.tower say I WOULD BE clear TO LAND ON runway AT ABOUT _ mile ON FINAL AS SOON AS aircraft clear THE runway.I WAS line UP ON WHAT appear TO BE A taxiway IT WAS AT LESS THAN _ mile approximate _ mile.ON FINAL TO taxiway I WAS clear TO LAND.I THOUGHT THIS WAS UNUSUAL BUT I HAD JUST HAD A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE AT OSHKOSH ON runway _ IN _ WHERE THEY HAD A runway AND runway.I WAS TOLD TO LAND ON runway.IT appear TO BE A taxiway JUST exact LIKE _.AT THE lastminute approximate _ mile ON FINAL I clear left AND land ON runway.THE tower say THAT I WAS suppose TO LAND ON runway.I say THERE WAS ONLY A taxiway THERE.THEY say THAT TODAY IT south A runway.I HAD NOT BEEN INTO EITHER airport BEFORE.

853~ON assignedheading _ degree clear VISUAL approach runway AT lax airport.DURING TURN TO FINAL HAD A trafficadvisory FROM A BRASILIA THAT WAS ON A VISUAL approach TO runway.THE trafficadvisory appear TO BE IN MY _ o'clock posit AND THAT traffic appear TO CONFLICT WITH MY TURN TO FINAL FOR runway.I divert MY attention FROM align WITH runway TO check THE MFD FOR THE trafficadvisory AND TO THEN ACQUIRE THE BRASILIA visual.I ALSO stop MY TURN TO FINAL INASMUCH AS THE trafficadvisory appear TO CONFLICT WITH THAT TURN.OVER THE NEXT FEW second I visual locate THE traffic BUT ALSO fly THROUGH THE centerline OF runway and left.I immediate UPON sight THE BRASILIA begin A left turnback TO ALIGN WITH runway AND maintain visualseparation FROM THE BRASILIA AND land ON runway.I HAD NO FURTHER trafficadvisory south AFTER THE INITIAL trafficadvisory.THE SIT WAS bring ABOUT BY receive A VISUAL approach clearance VERY CLOSE TO THE runwaycenterline WITH paralleltraffic IN THE PICTURE.HAD I BEEN clear TO BEGIN THE TURN TO FINAL FOR runway early THE GEOMETRY WITH THE BRASILIA WOULD HAVE BEEN differ AND MAY NOT HAVE result IN A trafficadvisory AND THE SUBSEQUENT ACTION I TOOK TO BE SURE THAT THE BRASILIA WAS IN FACT align WITH runway AND NOT runway.IT seem TO BE A fair commonoccurrence AT lax airport TO GET A SHORT TURN TO THIS north runway AND require A CONSTANT _ degree BANK ALL THE WAY TO FINAL WHICH IS SOMETIMES UNCOMFORTABLE FOR passenger.AN early VISUAL clearance WOULD ALLOW FOR MORE maneuver ROOM AND A MORE GENTLE TURN FROM THE baseleg VECTOR TO FINAL.
854~I WAS assign firstofficer ON OUR _ reposition flight.I BELIEVE WE WERE ON vector BY cos airport approach TO ATTEMPT TO LOCATE THE cos airport airport expect A VISUAL approach TO runway.THE captainpilotnotflying SET _ feet INTO THE altitudepreselect WINDOW WHILE descend THROUGH approximate _ feetmeansealevel believe IT WAS THE assign HE hear FROM airtrafficcontrol.descend THROUGH _ feetmeansealevel I slow THE descend AND level OFF AFTER THE TERRAIN appear TO BE unusual CLOSE.AT THAT MOMENT airtrafficcontrol state THAT THE altitudeassignment HAD BEEN _ feet AND THAT RADAR indicate OUR altitude TO BE _ feet.WE immediate climb BACK TO _ feet locate THE airport AND land uneventful.IN RETROSPECT A close evaluate OF THE runway approach PLATE WOULD HAVE clue ME IN TO THE ILLOGICAL _ feet select MADE BY THE captain.I WAS preoccupy BY MY SEARCH FOR THE airport AND DID NOT HEAR THE _ feet assign.I SHUDDER TO THINK OF WHAT MIGHT HAVE happen IN instrumentmeteorologicalconditions.A GOOD controlledflightintoterrain LESSON.THE captain LATER admit TO ACUTE FATIGUE.
855~AS WE WERE cruise AT _ feet ON THE CINCE THREE arrive WE WERE TOLD TO descend TO _ feet.UPON reach _ feet airtrafficcontrol request A confirm OF OUR altitude.WHEN WE reply THAT WE WERE AT _ feet airtrafficcontrol inform US THAT THE clearance TO descend TO _ feet WAS FOR ANOTHER aircraft WITH A similarcallsign.THE EVENT COULD VE BEEN avoid IF airtrafficcontrol HAD warn US OF ANOTHER aircraft ON THE samefrequency WITH A similarcallsign.
856~AS WE WERE descend DOWN FROM flightlevel TO A newaltitude OF _ feet airtrafficcontrol amend clearance TO CROSS TIGGR intersect AT _ feet.UPON reach TIGGR WE realize THAT WE HAD NOT SET THE autopilot south altitudepreselect FROM _ feet TO _ feet.THE ERROR WAS DUE TO THE pilotnotflying south fail TO SET THE newaltitude ON THE autopilot south altitude AND THE pilotflying south fail TO REALIZE THAT IT WAS NOT SET WHEN THE clearance WAS issue.
857~I RECALL be give runway BUT DID NOT WRITE DOWN THE clearance.I DO NOT RECALL read BACK THE clearance BUT DID TELL ground THAT I WAS UNFAMILIAR WITH THE airport AND THE taxiway STRUCTURE.I WAS instruct TO TAXI STRAIGHT AHEAD OUT OF THE TRANSIENT AREA AND THEN TURN left ONTO THE taxiway TO runway.I GUESS I WAS depend ON ground FOR guide IN THE UNFAMILIAR SIT.I proceed OUT OF THE TRANSIENT AREA BUT DID NOT immediate RECOGNIZE THE taxiway AS IT IS VERY NARROW AND THE runway JUST BEYOND IS WIDE AND easy see.confuse THE runway WITH THE taxiway I proceed TOWARD THE runway BUT THEN recognize MY MISTAKE AND stop.AT THE sameinstant ground call tell ME TO STOP.AT THAT POINT I WAS shock TO SEE A depart PLANE ON runway WHIZZING PAST NOT VERY FAR AWAY AND realize HOW CLOSE THAT MISTAKE HAD take ME.I DO NOT BELIEVE I EVER cross THAT HOLD SHORT LINE.I TOLD ground I HAD mistake THE runway FOR THE taxiway turn AND enter THE taxiway towardrunway.be distract BY on mistake ACTION I apparent DID NOT REMEMBER be TOLD TO HOLD SHORT OF runway _ AND continue ON THE taxiway IT IS ONLY A VERY shortdistance UNTIL be TOLD BY ground TO HALT THAT I WAS IN violate OF THE HOLD SHORT LINE OF runway _.I WAS TOLD TO HOLD IN PLACE FOR quit A FEW minute AND THEN clear TO TAXI TO runway AS desire.I MAY HAVE BEEN JUST ON OR ACROSS THE HOLD SHORT LINE BUT I AM CERTAIN THAT I WAS WELL SHORT OF THE runway ITSELF.I DID NOT OBSERVE ani traffic ON OR FOR runway _.BEFORE depart I WAS ask TO TELEPHONE THE tower ON MY arrive WHICH I DID.THE STRUCTURE OF THE taxiway AND runway IN THAT AREA IS VERY confuse FOR SOMEONE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE airport.NEITHER THE airway facilitydirectory NOR THE govern approach plate BOTH OF WHICH I consult BEFORE fly INTO PRESCOTT HAVE AN airportdiagram THAT IS us AT THIS POINT.THE airportdiagram SHOULD BE publish AND THE ENTRANCE direct ONTO runway FROM THE TRANSIENT AREA SHOULD BE close TO PREVENT THE confuse I experience.THE airportfacilitydirectory cite runway AS THE design calmwind runway.THE wind WERE CALM.runway WAS IN us.traffic seem TO BE LIGHT.I BELIEVE MOST studenttraining ACTIVITY us runway.ON MY arrive IN PRESCOTT THE previousday I HAD BEEN clear TO TAXI TO THE TRANSIENT AREA WITH NO MENTION OF THE intersectingrunway _.ON A CALM LIGHT traffic DAY I CANNOT IMAGINE WHY runway _ SHOULD BE IN us AT ALL.I SEE NO us FOR runway _ EXCEPT WHEN need BECAUSE OF HIGH crosswind ON runway.THE number OF runway _ AND _ IS ITSELF confuse.IT IS EASY TO MISTAKE A transpose OF THE _ digit.IN TUCSON MY homebase THE samesituation HAS BEEN rectify BY RENUMBERING WHAT SHOULD actual BE runway AS runway.THE head IS real _ degree.I SUGGEST THAT PRESCOTT SHOULD RENUMBER runway _ AS runway _ INSTEAD TO REDUCE possibleconfusion.ONCE ground HAD see THAT I WAS experience difficult WITH on taxiway runway SIT I THINK THEY COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE help IN guide ME IN taxi runway _ WITH advise BEFORE I reach THE HOLD SHORT LINE NOT wait UNTIL AFTER A violate.IN THE FUTURE I SHALL BE extreme care ABOUT understand clearance special IN UNFAMILIAR SITS.
